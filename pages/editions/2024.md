We curated a list of this year’s publications — including links to social media, lab websites, and supplemental material. We have 58 full papers, 13 LBWs, one DC paper, and one Student Game Competition, and we lead five workshops. Two papers were awarded a best paper award, and four papers received an honourable mention.
