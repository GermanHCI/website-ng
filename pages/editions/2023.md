This year’s CHI conference will take place in Hamburg, Germany, as a hybrid event (April 23 – April 28, 2023). To honor the tradition of the German HCI event, we curated this website, including details on this year’s publications from involved labs of the German HCI community.

## Publications and Talks
We curated a list of this year’s publications — including links to social media, lab websites, and supplemental material. We have six journal articles, 67 full papers, 30 LBWs, eleven interactivities, one alt.chi paper, one DC paper, lead three workshops and give two courses. Four papers were awarded a best paper award, and seven papers received an honourable mention.

## Participating Labs
This year’s edition is a joint effort by 38 labs from over 20 German Universities.

## German HCI Event
This year’s German HCI Event/Party will happen on Wednesday, 26th April starting at 8 PM. The invitations went out — so check your inboxes. We welcome everyone with a CHI badge as long as we have space; please find us at CHI to get to know the location.
