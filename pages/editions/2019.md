From immersive virtual reality over 3D printed materials to personal health tracking—the German HCI labs cover a manifold range of topics.

This year, we contribute 98 publications in total to the 2019 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. At the heart, there are 53 Papers, including 1 Best Paper and 8 Honorable Mentions. Further, we bring 28 Late Breaking Work, 9 Demonstrations, 4 organized Workshops & Symposia, 2 Video Showcases, 1 Case Study, and 1 Doctoral Consortium participation to CHI this year. We curated our publications in a booklet, which is available for download here.

On Wednesday evening, our German HCI Event took place in an amazing location called Argyle St. Arches, right under the central station. With almost 1000 attendees it was the biggest German HCI event so far as well as one of the biggest network event co-located with the ACM CHI conference.
