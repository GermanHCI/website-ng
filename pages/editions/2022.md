This year’s CHI conference will take place in New Orleans, US as a hybrid event (April 30 – May 5, 2022). To honor the tradition of the German HCI event, we curated this website including details on this year’s publications from involved labs of the German HCI community.

We curated a list of this year’s publications — including links to social media, lab websites, and supplemental material. Additionally, we provide a schedule for all talks — don’t miss them!

Feel free to catch up in our Gather.town space.
