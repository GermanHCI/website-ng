Also in 2018, we as the German HCI community invited participants of the ACM CHI conference to our German HCI Event in the Taverne Moderne in the city of Montreal. For the first time, we also offered a printed booklet listing our 58 full papers that were presented at CHI that year.

The booklet is available for download here.
