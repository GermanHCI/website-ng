To allow all CHI attendees to get to know the beautiful city of Hamburg, we propose a self-organized city tour instead of having a single centralized event. We collected recommendations on what to see and visit during that time and prepared example routes for you to take during this evening. Attendees might connect to others before leaving to explore the city at the Explore Hamburg Info Point in the Foyer of CCH on <b>Tuesday, April 25, from 5:30 – 6:30 pm</b>.

For Tuesday evening, we recommend the following options to ensure that attendees can meet each other and explore Hamburg together. <b>For all sites, it is strongly recommended that you book your tickets in advance.</b>

<i>Disclaimer: ACM CHI does not organize the visits nor cover any costs and is, therefore, not responsible for any events.</i>
