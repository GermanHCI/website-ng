<h3 class="head-text">What to Expect</h3>
Through short paper <b>presentations and panel discussions</b> with international experts in the respective field, we aim to increase the visibility of the German HCI research and enable authors to receive valuable feedback on their work they would miss without CHI. <br/><br/> 
The event is <b>open to everyone</b> (with no registration required) and we hope to see many of you there. All talks and discussion will be in English!<br/><br/> 
The sessions will be <b>hosted via a Zoom Webinar</b> and allow for actively participating in the Q&As. In case you cannot or do not want to use Zoom, we will also <b>live stream</b> the sessions <b>on YouTube</b>. The sessions will not be recorded. After the last session on each day, we invite everyone to join us on Mozilla Hub for a after-work hangout.<br/> <br/>
