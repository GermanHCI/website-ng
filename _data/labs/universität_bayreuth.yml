    info: "We conduct research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) with two goals: AI for better UIs: Improving user interfaces through the use of computational methods to make digital technology more effective, efficient, and expressive to use. Better UIs for AI: Making AI systems interactive to enable humans to better explore, steer, and apply AI, and to extend human capabilities in challenging tasks. Together, we thus explore AI as a tool to empower people instead of replacing them."
