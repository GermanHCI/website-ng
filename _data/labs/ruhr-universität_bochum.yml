    info: "DigiSoul – the Digital Sovereignty Lab led by Prof. Dr. Karola Marky, has been part of the Faculty of Computer Science at the Ruhr University Bochum since 2022. The Chair is associated with the Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security (HGI), and the Cluster of Excellence for Cyber Security (CASA).DigiSoul’s research is primarily focused on the intersection of cybersecurity and privacy research with human factors. We specifically investigate the capacity of individuals (e.g., end-users or developers), institutions (e.g., universities or companies), or states (e.g., administrations or governments) for informational self-determination.

    info: "I am a tenure-track faculty member (W2) leading the Responsible Computing group. In the Responsible Computing group, we study online socio-technical systems—the algorithms, the people, the legal regulations, the interfaces and the data. We seek to understand both the influence online systems have on user behavior, cognition, and well-being, as well as the impacts of user biases and preferences on the functioning of those systems."
