  abstract: "{Heightened AI expectations facilitate performance in human-AI interactions
    through placebo effects. While lowering expectations to control for placebo effects
    is advisable, overly negative expectations could induce nocebo effects. In a letter
    discrimination task, we informed participants that an AI would either increase
    or decrease their performance by adapting the interface, when in reality, no AI
    was present in any condition. A Bayesian analysis showed that participants had
    high expectations and performed descriptively better irrespective of the AI description
    when a sham-AI was present. Using cognitive modeling, we could trace this advantage
    back to participants gathering more information. A replication study verified
    that negative AI descriptions do not alter expectations, suggesting that performance
    expectations with AI are biased and robust to negative verbal descriptions. We
    discuss the impact of user expectations on AI interactions and evaluation.}"

  abstract: "{Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have been widely adopted in
    work contexts. We explore the impact of ChatGPT on young professionals’ perception
    of productivity and sense of accomplishment. We collected LLMs’ main use cases
    in knowledge work through a preliminary study, which served as the basis for a
    two-week diary study with 21 young professionals reflecting on their ChatGPT use.
    Findings indicate that ChatGPT enhanced some participants’ perceptions of productivity
    and accomplishment by enabling greater creative output and satisfaction from efficient
    tool utilization. Others experienced decreased perceived productivity and accomplishment,
    driven by a diminished sense of ownership, perceived lack of challenge, and mediocre
    results. We found that the suitability of task delegation to ChatGPT varies strongly
    depending on the task nature. It’s especially suitable for comprehending broad
    subject domains, generating creative solutions, and uncovering new information.
    It’s less suitable for research tasks due to hallucinations, which necessitate
    extensive validation.}"

  abstract: "{The museum is changing from a place of passive consumption to a place
    of interactive experiences, opening up new ways of engaging with exhibits and
    others. As a promising direction, this paper explores the potential of telepresence
    stations in the museum context to enhance social connectedness among visitors
    over distance. Emphasizing the significance of social exchange, our research focuses
    on studying telepresence to foster interactions between strangers, share knowledge,
    and promote social connectedness. To do so, we first observe exhibitions and then
    interview individual visitors of a technical museum about their experiences and
    needs. Based on the results, we design appropriate voiceless and touchless communication
    channels and test them in a study. The findings of our in-situ user study with
    24 visitors unfamiliar with each other in the museum provide insights into behaviors
    and perceptions, contributing valuable knowledge on seamlessly integrating telepresence
    technology in exhibitions, with a focus on enhancing learning, social connections,
    and the museum experience in general.}"

  abstract: "{Recent advances in language processing and speech recognition open up
    a large opportunity for video game companies to embrace voice interaction as an
    intuitive feature and appealing game mechanics. However, speech-based systems
    still remain liable to recognition errors. These add a layer of challenge on top
    of the game’s existing obstacles, preventing players from reaching their goals
    and thus often resulting in player frustration. This work investigates a novel
    method called context-aware speech recognition, where the game environment and
    actions are used as supplementary information to enhance recognition in a speech-based
    game. In a between-subject user study (N = 40), we compared our proposed method
    with a standard method in which recognition is based only on the voice input without
    taking context into account. Our results indicate that our proposed method could
    improve the player experience and the usability of the speech system.}"

  abstract: "{Electrodermal activity (EDA) reflects changes in skin conductance, which
    are closely tied to human psychophysiological states. For example, EDA sensors
    can assess stress, cognitive workload, arousal, or other measures tied to the
    sympathetic nervous system for interactive human-centered applications. Yet, current
    limitations involve the complex attachment and proper skin contact with EDA sensors.
    This paper explores the concept of 3D printing electrodes for EDA measurements,
    integrating sensors into arbitrary 3D-printed objects, alleviating the need for
    complex assembly and attachment. We examine the adaptation of conventional EDA
    circuits for 3D-printed electrodes, assessing different electrode shapes and their
    impact on the sensing accuracy. A user study (N=6) revealed that 3D-printed electrodes
    can measure EDA with similar accuracy, suggesting larger contact areas for improved
    precision. We derive design implications to facilitate the integration of EDA
    sensors into 3D-printed devices to foster diverse integration into everyday objects
    for prototyping physiological interfaces.}"
