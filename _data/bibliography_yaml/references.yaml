  abstract: "{Compelling writing is tailored to its audience. This is challenging,
    as writers may struggle to empathize with readers, get feedback in time, or gain
    access to the target group. We propose a concept that generates on-demand feedback,
    based on writer-defined AI personas of any target audience. We explore this concept
    with a prototype (using GPT-3.5) in two user studies (N=5 and N=11): Writers appreciated
    the concept and strategically used personas for getting different perspectives.
    The feedback was seen as helpful and inspired revisions of text and personas,
    although it was often verbose and unspecific. We discuss the impact of on-demand
    feedback, the limited representativity of contemporary AI systems, and further
    ideas for defining AI personas. This work contributes to the vision of supporting
    writers with AI by expanding the socio-technical perspective in AI tool design:
    To empower creators, we also need to keep in mind their relationship to an audience.}"

    offers opportunities that are impossible in the real world (e.g., telekinesis).
    So far, there is no design support to exploit the potential of such “impossible”
    augmentations, especially for serious applications. We developed a card set and
    a workshop format, which features 15 opportunities to facilitate the ideation
    of augmentation-oriented VR. We piloted the method in five workshops with people
    in the early stages of developing a VR application (N=35). Participants found
    the cards easy to use and to inspire viable new concepts that differed from earlier
    ideas. Analysis of the concepts with interaction criticism identified two strategies:
    (1) augmentations that are only loosely related to the purpose of the application,
    simply to increase “fun”, and (2) augmentations that are closely related to the
    core purpose and thereby subtly facilitate its fulfillment. The latter has the
    greater potential.}"

    of EMS regarding social and technological acceptance, showing that there is greater
    acceptance of applications that manipulate action than those that manipulate perception.

    their use-case-specific pipeline to overcome the issue, ranging from ignoring
    missing data to artificial interpolation. With these first insights, we run a
    large-scale analysis on 11 publicly available datasets to understand the impact
    of the various approaches on data quality and accuracy. By this, we highlight
    the pitfalls in data processing and which methods work best. Based on our results,

    typically assessed and validated through costly and logistically demanding analogue
    field studies. While interactive simulations in Virtual Reality (VR) offer a comparatively
    cost-effective alternative, they have faced criticism for lacking the fidelity
    of real-world deployments. This paper explores the applicability of passive haptic
    interfaces in bridging the gap between simulated and real-world ConOps assessments.
    Leveraging passive haptic props (equipment mockup and astronaut gloves), we virtually
    recreated the Apollo 12 mission procedure and assessed it with experienced astronauts
    and other space experts. Quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that haptics
    increased presence and embodiment, thus improving perceived simulation fidelity
    and validity of user reflections. We conclude by discussing the potential role
    of passive haptic modalities in facilitating early-stage ConOps assessments for
    human endeavours on the Moon and beyond.}"

  abstract: "{To enhance interactions in VR, many techniques introduce offsets between
    the virtual and real-world position of users’ hands. Nevertheless, such hand redirection
    (HR) techniques are only effective as long as they go unnoticed by users—not disrupting
    the VR experience. While several studies consider how much unnoticeable redirection
    can be applied, these focus on mid-air floating hands that are disconnected from
    users’ bodies. Increasingly, VR avatars are embodied as being directly connected
    with the user’s body, which provide more visual cue anchoring, and may therefore
    reduce the unnoticeable redirection threshold. In this work, we studied more complete
    avatars and their effect on the sense of embodiment and the detectability of HR.
    We found that higher avatar completeness increases embodiment, and we provide
    evidence for the absence of practically relevant effects on the detectability
    of HR.}"

    Participants saw a stated screen refresh rate before every condition, which corresponded
    to the true refresh rate only in half of the conditions and was lower or higher
    in the other half. Results revealed successful priming, as participants believed
    in superior or inferior performance based on the narrative despite using the opposite
    refresh rate. Post-experiment questionnaires confirmed participants still held
    onto the initial narrative. Interestingly, the objective performance remained

    evaluating projective AR visualizations. A virtual twin of a real laboratory environment
    was created, and a user study comparing two needle navigation visualizations was
    conducted. The study simulated identical experiments in both AR and VR to assess
    if similar results would emerge. Our findings indicate that both AR and VR experiments
    exhibited comparable effects in terms of performance and workload of both needle

    Detailed technical parameters and the implementation of our device are provided.
    A controlled experiment confirms the technique can (1) create virtual compliance;
    (2) adjust the compliance magnitude with grain and electrode parameters; and (3)
    render compliance with specific shapes. In three example applications, we present
    how this illusion can enhance physical objects, elements in graphical user interfaces,
    and virtual reality experiences.}"

    this gap we introduce SalChartQA – a novel crowd-sourced dataset that uses the
    BubbleView interface to track user attention and a question-answering (QA) paradigm
    to induce different information needs in users. SalChartQA contains 74,340 answers
    to 6,000 questions on 3,000 visualisations. Informed by our analyses demonstrating
    the close correlation between information needs and visual saliency, we propose
    the first computational method to predict question-driven saliency on visualisations.
    Our method outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models for several metrics, such
    as the correlation coefficient and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results
    show the importance of information needs for shaping attentive behaviour and pave
    the way for new applications, such as task-driven optimisation of visualisations
    or explainable AI in chart question-answering.}"

    through embodied and practical inputs (e.g., gestures, recommendations) and evaluation

    pARam for HoloLens 2 and evaluated it (n = 20), comparing XR and desktop conditions.
    Users succeeded in choosing context-related parameters and took their environment

    We found no objective change in pedestrians’ willingness to cross the road based
    on the nature of eHMI, although people expressed different subjective preferences
    for the different ways an eHMI may communicate, and sometimes even strong dislike

    cues are significantly better at conveying an embodied sense of movement than
    the corresponding visual stimulus, and that combining vibrotactile and visual

  abstract: "{Detailed digital representations of physical scenes are key in many
    cases, such as historical site preservation or hazardous area inspection. To automate
    the capturing process, robots or drones mounted with sensors can algorithmically
    record the environment from different viewpoints. However, environmental complexities
    often lead to incomplete captures. We believe humans can support scene capture
    as their contextual understanding enables easy identification of missing areas
    and recording errors. Therefore, they need to perceive the recordings and suggest
    new sensor poses. In this work, we compare two human-centric approaches in Virtual
    Reality for scene reconstruction through the teleoperation of a remote robot arm,
    i.e., directly providing sensor poses (direct method) or specifying missing areas
    in the scans (indirect method). Our results show that directly providing sensor
    poses leads to higher efficiency and user experience. In future work, we aim to
    compare the quality of human assistance to automatic approaches.}"

    a rapid growth in the popularity of conversational user interfaces (CUIs). While
    CUIs introduce novel benefits, they also yield risks that may exploit people’s
    trust. Although research looking at unethical design deployed through graphical
    user interfaces (GUIs) established a thorough understanding of so-called dark
    patterns, there is a need to continue this discourse within the CUI community
    to understand potentially problematic interactions. Addressing this gap, we interviewed
    27 participants from three cohorts: researchers, practitioners, and frequent users
    of CUIs. Applying thematic analysis, we construct five themes reflecting each
    cohort’s insights about ethical design challenges and introduce the CUI Expectation
    Cycle, bridging system capabilities and user expectations while considering each
    theme’s ethical caveats. This research aims to inform future development of CUIs
    to consider ethical constraints while adopting a human-centred approach.}"

    the topic further with loved ones. Participants (N=100) talked with the chatbot
    for an average of 25 minutes. It offered conversations about planning for one’s
    own death, end-of-life preferences, and hopes for the afterlife. We measured participants’
    fear and acceptance of death (DAP-R questionnaire) and readiness for end-of-life
    conversation (REOLC questionnaire) before and after the chat. Overall, attitudes
    toward death improved and fear decreased, while readiness for end-of-life conversations
    increased. Bigger changes in attitude corresponded with longer, more reflective
    responses in the conversations, commitment to plans, finding meaning in death,
    and some notion of legacy or afterlife.}"

    on-the-ground, they acted as keyboard fighters to organize protests, to share
    information, and to support the civil disobedience movement in Myanmar. The study
    identifies, inter alia, the need for better offline applications with wider coverage

    it is strikingly absent for VR systems in research and industry. This work addresses
    this research gap by exploring different undo techniques for basic object manipulation
    in different collaboration modes in VR. We conducted a study involving 32 participants
    organized in teams of two. Here, we studied users’ performance and preferences
    in a tower stacking task, varying the available undo techniques and their mode

    when manual drivers try to enter a highway. Therefore, we report the results of

    (single vs. multiple, i.e., four, gaps) and communication strategies (HUD, AR,

    hallucinations which can lead to misinterpretations and errors. To tackle the
    problem of overreliance, we propose HILL, the "Hallucination Identifier for Large

    of Oz approach with nine participants. Subsequently, we implemented HILL based
    on the identified design features and evaluated HILL’s interface design by surveying
    17 participants. Further, we investigated HILL’s functionality to identify hallucinations
    based on an existing question-answering dataset and five user interviews. We find
    that HILL can correctly identify and highlight hallucinations in LLM responses
    which enables users to handle LLM responses with more caution. With that, we propose
    an easy-to-implement adaptation to existing LLMs and demonstrate the relevance
    of user-centered designs of AI artifacts.}'

    of generating fundamental knowledge for SportsHCI more broadly to advance the
    field as a whole. To achieve this, we aim to identify the grand challenges in
    SportsHCI, which can help researchers and practitioners in developing a future
    research agenda. Hence, this paper presents a set of grand challenges identified
    in a five-day workshop with 22 experts who have previously researched, designed,
    and deployed SportsHCI systems. Addressing these challenges will drive transformative
    advancements in SportsHCI, fostering better athlete performance, athlete-coach

  abstract: "{Speech is a natural interface for humans to interact with robots. Yet,
    aligning a robot’s voice to its appearance is challenging due to the rich vocabulary
    of both modalities. Previous research has explored a few labels to describe robots
    and tested them on a limited number of robots and existing voices. Here, we develop
    a robot-voice creation tool followed by large-scale behavioral human experiments
    (N=2,505). First, participants collectively tune robotic voices to match 175 robot
    images using an adaptive human-in-the-loop pipeline. Then, participants describe
    their impression of the robot or their matched voice using another human-in-the-loop
    paradigm for open-ended labeling. The elicited taxonomy is then used to rate robot
    attributes and to predict the best voice for an unseen robot. We offer a web interface
    to aid engineers in customizing robot voices, demonstrating the synergy between
    cognitive science and machine learning for engineering tools.}"

    the use of gamification is rare, and when it is implemented, it often lacks thoughtful

    and examined two in more detail: difficulty levels and a kit, where the user has
    to assemble a virtual liver using US. In a broad audience study, levels achieved
    significantly better results regarding enjoyment. Qualitative feedback from medical
    students directly comparing the elements revealed that they prefer the kit as
    well as levels for training. Our studies indicate that levels and the more interactive

  abstract: "{Eye contact represents a fundamental element of human social interactions,
    providing essential non-verbal signals. Traditionally, it has played a crucial
    role in fostering social bonds during in-person gatherings. However, in the realm
    of virtual and online meetings, the capacity for meaningful eye contact is often
    compromised by the limitations of the platforms we use. In response to this challenge,
    we present an application framework that leverages webcams to detect and share
    eye gaze attention among participants. Through the framework, we organized 13
    group meetings involving a total of 43 participants. The results highlight that
    the inclusion of gaze attention can enrich interactive experiences and elevate
    engagement levels in online meetings. Additionally, our evaluation of two levels
    of gaze sharing schemes indicates that users predominantly favor viewing gaze
    attention directed toward themselves, as opposed to visualizing detailed attention,
    which tends to lead to distraction and information overload.}"

    We found that the attributes that correlated most strongly with participants’
    perceptions of the established tangible privacy mechanisms were their “need for
    touch” and previous experiences with the mechanisms. We use our findings to identify
    desirable characteristics of tangible mechanisms to better inform future tangible,

    This paper explores an alternative approach by simulating navigational HUD concepts
    in a high-fidelity Virtual Reality (VR) representation of the lunar environment.
    In evaluating these concepts with astronauts and other aerospace experts (n=25),
    our mixed methods study demonstrates the efficacy of simulated analogues in facilitating
    rapid design assessments of early-stage HUD solutions. We illustrate this by elaborating
    key design challenges and guidelines for future lunar HUDs. In reflecting on the

    guidance, the “feedforward’’ provides instructional cues of the motions that are

    providing an effective learning experience, but this interplay between the two
    has not yet been adequately explored. Based on a survey of the literature, we
    propose design space for both motion feedforward and corrective feedback in XR,
    and describe the interaction effects between them. We identify common design approaches
    of XR-based motion guidance found in our literature corpus, and discuss them through
    the lens of our design dimensions. We then discuss additional contextual factors

    the previously proposed approaches of gradual hand warping and blink-suppressed
    hand redirection with the novel approach of saccadic redirection in one unified
    yet simple algorithm. We compare three variants of the proposed Saccadic \\& Blink-Suppressed
    Hand Redirection (SBHR) technique with the conventional approach to redirection
    in a psychophysical study (N = 25). Our results highlight the great potential
    of our proposed technique for comfortable redirection by showing that SBHR allows
    for significantly greater magnitudes of unnoticeable redirection while being perceived
    as significantly less intrusive and less noticeable than commonly employed techniques
    that only use gradual hand warping.}"

    Compared to no cue, both cues significantly reduced the resumption lag (i.e.,
    the time between the end of the interruption and the resumption of the primary
    task) following long but not short interruptions. Experiment 2 (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;38)
    involved a tangible sorting task, utilizing only the automatic cue. The AR cue

    To address this challenge, we present the Mixed Reality Concerns (MRC) Questionnaire,

    The development followed a structured process considering previous work, expert
    interviews, iterative refinements, and confirmatory tests to analytically validate

    legislative, practitioner, and regulatory space has likely limited the impact
    that scholarship on dark patterns might have in supporting sanctions and evolved

    of dark patterns and proposing a three-level ontology with standardized definitions
    for 64 synthesized dark pattern types across low-, meso-, and high-level patterns.

  abstract: '{Wrist-based input often requires tuning parameter settings in correspondence
    to between-user and between-session differences, such as variations in hand anatomy,
    wearing position, posture, etc. Traditionally, users either work with predefined
    parameter values not optimized for individuals or undergo time-consuming calibration
    processes. We propose an online Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based method for rapidly
    determining the user-specific optimal settings of wrist-based pointing. Specifically,
    we develop a meta-Bayesian optimization (meta-BO) method, differing from traditional
    human-in-the-loop BO: By incorporating meta-learning of prior optimization data
    from a user population with BO, meta-BO enables rapid calibration of parameters
    for new users with a handful of trials. We evaluate our method with two representative
    and distinct wrist-based interactions: absolute and relative pointing. On a weighted-sum
    metric that consists of completion time, aiming error, and trajectory quality,

    limitations involve the complex attachment and proper skin contact with EDA sensors.
    This paper explores the concept of 3D printing electrodes for EDA measurements,
    integrating sensors into arbitrary 3D-printed objects, alleviating the need for
    complex assembly and attachment. We examine the adaptation of conventional EDA
    circuits for 3D-printed electrodes, assessing different electrode shapes and their
    impact on the sensing accuracy. A user study (N=6) revealed that 3D-printed electrodes
    can measure EDA with similar accuracy, suggesting larger contact areas for improved

    medicine and fitness, while its application in areas where these two fields overlap
    has been barely explored. We argue that AR opens up new opportunities to interact
    with, understand and share personal health data. To this end, we developed an
    app prototype that uses a Snapchat-like face filter to visualize personal health
    data from a fitness tracker in AR. We tested this prototype in two pilot studies
    and found that AR does have potential in this type of application. We suggest
    that AR cannot replace the current interfaces of smartwatches and mobile apps,
    but it can pick up where current technology falls short in creating intrinsic
    motivation and personal health awareness. We also provide ideas for future work
    in this direction.}"

    investigate past experiences with authentication mechanisms emphasizing problems
    and aspects that hamper good user experience. Second, we investigate the different
    authentication factors more closely. Our results reveal particularly interesting
    preferences regarding the authentication factor “ownership” in terms of properties,
    physical realizations, and interaction. These findings suggest a path toward 2FA
    mechanisms with considerably better user experience, promising to improve the
    acceptance and hence, the proliferation of 2FA for the benefit of security in

    examination of ideological differences concerning what ‘sharing’ might mean. Our
    findings show that community building is dependent on the negotiation of different
    values and purposes identified. We derive recommendations for action-oriented
    researchers ultimately concerned with systemic transformation.}"

    advertising emails, which was related to feeling surveilled by companies, forced
    subscription, high prior knowledge about persuasive tactics, and a desire for
    more agency. We also found that using certain persuasive tactics on the inbox

    how humans perceive the danger level of objects. Thus, we created a database of
    153 kitchen objects and conducted an online survey (N=300) investigating their
    perceived danger level. We found that (1) humans perceive kitchen objects vastly
    differently, (2) the object-holder has a strong effect on the danger perception,
    and (3) prior user knowledge increases the perceived danger of robots handling
    those objects. This shows that future human-robot collaboration studies must investigate
    different objects for a holistic image. We contribute a wiki-like open-source

  abstract: "{Research in HCI has shown a growing interest in unethical design practices

    a gap in related literature regarding social networking services (SNSs). In this
    context, studies emphasise a lack of users’ self-determination regarding control
    over personal data and time spent on SNSs. We collected over 16 hours of screen
    recordings from Facebook’s, Instagram’s, TikTok’s, and Twitter’s mobile applications
    to understand how dark patterns manifest in these SNSs. For this task, we turned
    towards HCI experts to mitigate possible difficulties of non-expert participants
    in recognising dark patterns, as prior studies have noticed. Supported by the
    recordings, two authors of this paper conducted a thematic analysis based on previously
    described taxonomies, manually classifying the recorded material while delivering
    two key findings: We observed which instances occur in SNSs and identified two
    strategies — engaging and governing — with five dark patterns undiscovered before.}"

    lens on physical therapy for children and adolescents. Results from in-depth interviews
    with twelve therapists show that they carefully adjust sessions to allow patients
    to experience competence, making more comprehensive adjustments than currently
    offered by games. Additionally, we highlight how therapists leverage their relationship
    with patients to support motivation, but struggle to reconcile meaningful experiences
    of autonomy with therapeutic goals. On this basis, we reflect on implications
    for researchers and designers who create games for physical therapy, and the potential
    of SDT to provide a foundation for game design and therapeutic practice.}"

    Results show that ATI values were rather high, with broader range only in maritime
    traffic operators. Furthermore, the assessment of autonomy is more strongly related

    context portals and driving-path events as automotive-specific visualizations.
    To validate AutoVis against real-world analysis tasks, we implemented a prototype,
    conducted heuristic walkthroughs using authentic data from a case study and public
    datasets, and leveraged a real vehicle in the analysis process.}"

    contributions in a participatory process. Recent years have shown that unforeseen
    external factors pose a risk of exacerbating this power imbalance by limiting
    in-person meetings and communication in general. This study evaluated a projects’
    power relations using a three-part reflection-on-action approach. Results show,
    that external factors can act as an actor in the power relationship model and
    that the change of initiative can change the power relations. Thus, we propose
    a power relation triangle for Participatory Design processes, including participants,
    designers and external conditions as actors and the decision-making at the center
    based on the combination of the actor’s relations. This framework can help to
    better understand and address power imbalances in Participatory Design.}"

    an experience prototype that guides parents through an incremental disclosure
    process using interactive storytelling. In a second study, we evaluate the prototype

    e.g. “Write about the adventures of the fox.”). With this lens, we study how 129
    crowd workers on Prolific write short texts with different user interfaces (1

    the interface offered multiple suggestions and provided an option for non-diegetic
    prompting, participants preferred choosing from multiple suggestions over controlling
    them via non-diegetic prompts. When participants provided non-diegetic prompts
    it was to ask for inspiration, topics or facts. Single suggestions in particular
    were guided both with diegetic and non-diegetic information. This work informs

    Pursuits is faster than Dwell time and Gaze gestures especially when there are
    many targets. Users prefer Pursuits when stationary, but prefer Dwell time when
    walking. While selection using Gaze gestures is more demanding and slower when

  abstract: "{Leveraging crowdsourcing in software development has received growing
    attention in research and practice. Crowd feedback offers a scalable and flexible
    way to evaluate software design solutions and the potential of crowd-feedback
    systems has been demonstrated in different contexts by existing research studies.
    However, previous research lacks a deep understanding of the effects of individual
    design features of crowd-feedback systems on feedback quality and quantity. Additionally,
    existing studies primarily focused on understanding the requirements of feedback
    requesters but have not fully explored the qualitative perspectives of crowd-based
    feedback providers. In this paper, we address these research gaps with two research
    studies. In study 1, we conducted a feature analysis (N=10) and concluded that
    from a user perspective, a crowd-feedback system should have five core features
    (scenario, speech-to-text, markers, categories, and star rating). In the second
    study, we analyzed the effects of the design features on crowdworkers' perceptions
    and feedback outcomes (N=210). We learned that offering feedback providers scenarios
    as the context of use is perceived as most important. Regarding the resulting
    feedback quality, we discovered that more features are not always better as overwhelming
    feedback providers might decrease feedback quality. Offering feedback providers
    categories as inspiration can increase the feedback quantity. With our work, we
    contribute to research on crowd-feedback systems by aligning crowdworker perspectives
    and feedback outcomes and thereby making the software evaluation not only more
    scalable but also more human-centered.}"

    propose a novel deep-learning super-resolution network to facilitate fiducial
    tangibles on capacitive touchscreens better. In detail, our network super-resolves
    the markers enabling off-the-shelf detection algorithms to track tangibles reliably.
    Our network generalizes to unseen marker sets, such as AprilTag, ArUco, and ARToolKit.
    Therefore, we are not limited to a fixed number of distinguishable objects and
    do not require data collection and network training for new fiducial markers.
    With extensive evaluation, including real-world users and five showcases, we demonstrate
    the applicability of our open-source approach on commodity mobile devices and
    further highlight the potential of tangibles on capacitive touchscreens.}"

    playground equipment, workout devices, and interactive kinetic installations.
    While recent research has been focusing on generating mechanisms that produce
    specific movement-path, without considering the required energy for the motion
    (kinematic approach), Trusscillator supports users in designing mechanisms that
    recycle energy in the system in the form of oscillating mechanisms (dynamic approach),
    specifically with the help of coil-springs. The presented system features a novel
    set of tools tailored for designing the dynamic experience of the motion. These
    tools allow designers to focus on user experience-specific aspects, such as motion
    range, tempo, and effort while abstracting away the underlying technicalities
    of eigenfrequencies, spring constants, and energy. Since the forces involved in
    the resulting devices can be high, Trusscillator helps users to fabricate from
    steel by picking out appropriate steal springs, generating part lists, and producing
    stencils and welding jigs that help weld with precision. To validate our system,
    we designed, built, and tested a series of unique playground equipment featuring
    2-4 degrees of movement.}"

  abstract: "{This paper presents an inspirational concept for companion technology
    design, uncontrollability, and a corresponding artefact, the Blessing Companion.
    Both originated from a research through design project exploring companion technologies
    for blessing rituals. We established an exchange with Protestant theologians,
    explored believers’ experiences of blessings, co-speculated on potential technologies,
    and refined the resulting ideas through ideation, prototyping, and testing. Inspired
    by believers’ descriptions of blessing experiences as not plannable, predictable,
    controllable, or enforceable, we adopted the concept of uncontrollability, explored
    how it might be implemented in companion technologies, and designed the Blessing
    Companion. The Blessing Companion embodies uncontrollability through its ambiguous
    appearance and (partly) uncontrollable behaviour. It thus stands in contrast to
    the prevailing on-demand and user-driven interaction paradigms. We discuss how
    uncontrollability can be reflected in content, form, and interaction, highlight
    respective possibilities for companion technologies, and reflect on the Blessing
    Companion as an example of designing for religious rituals.}"

    honoring and letting go. We show that technology can help to capture the identity
    of the deceased, to validate the life lived, and to come to terms with death.
    However, available approaches focus more on the bereaved than on the dying. In

    of soft robots compared to rigid robots because their natural way of movement
    helps users to relate to scenarios they know from everyday life, making the interaction
    with the soft robot feel more intuitive. However, the variety of soft robotics
    shape designs, and how to integrate them into applications, have not been explored
    fully yet. In a user study, we investigated users’ associations and ideas for
    application areas for 36 soft robotics shape designs, brainstormed with users
    beforehand. We derived first design recommendations for soft robotics designs
    such as clear signifiers indicating the possible motion.}"

    actions (e.g., redirection techniques) and amplify haptic perceptions (e.g., weight).
    However, their ability to amplify or induce negative perceptions such as physical
    pain is not well understood. In this work, we explore if PMs can be leveraged
    to induce the perception of pain, without modifying the physical stimulus. We
    implemented a VR experience combined with a haptic prototype, simulating the dislocation
    of a finger. A user study (n=18) compared three conditions (visual-only, haptic-only
    and combined) on the perception of physical pain and physical discomfort. We observed
    that using PMs with a haptic device resulted in a significantly higher perception
    of physical discomfort and an increase in the perception of pain compared to the
    unmodified sensation (haptic-only). Finally, we discuss how perception of pain
    can be leveraged in future VR applications and reflect on ethical concerns.}"

  abstract: "{Exploring virtual worlds together with others adds a social component
    to the Virtual Reality (VR) experience that increases connectedness. In the physical
    world, joint locomotion comes naturally through implicit intention communication
    and subsequent adjustments of the movement patterns. In VR, however, discrete
    locomotion techniques such as point&teleport come without prior intention communication,
    hampering the collective experience. Related work proposes fixed groups, with
    a single person controlling the group movement, resulting in the loss of individual
    movement capabilities. To close the gap and mediate between these two extremes,
    we introduce three intention communication methods and explore them with two baseline
    methods. We contribute the results of a controlled experiment (n=20) investigating
    these methods from the perspective of a leader and a follower in a dyadic locomotion
    task. Our results suggest shared visualizations support the understanding of movement

    We exemplify the concept of mixed-initiative physical sketching with a working
    robotic printer that can be handheld for free-hand sketching, can provide interactive
    assistance during sketching, or move about for computer-generated sketches. We
    present interaction techniques to seamlessly transition between modes, and sketching
    techniques benefitting from these transitions to, e.g., extend (upscale, repeat)

    importantly, the user’s field of view is not obscured by user interface elements,

    when the visual channel is already busy, or the visual sense is limited. We developed
    three design variants based on different vibrotactile illusions to communicate
    3D directional cues. In particular, we explored two variants based on the vibrotactile
    illusion of the cutaneous rabbit and one based on apparent vibrotactile motion.
    To communicate gradient information, we combined these with pulse-based and intensity-based
    mapping. A subsequent study showed that the pulse-based variants based on the
    vibrotactile illusion of the cutaneous rabbit are suitable for communicating both
    directional and gradient characteristics. The results further show that a representation

  abstract: "{Robots are becoming increasingly omnipresent in our daily lives, supporting
    us and carrying out autonomous tasks. In Human-Robot Interaction, human actors
    benefit from understanding the robot’s motion intent to avoid task failures and
    foster collaboration. Finding effective ways to communicate this intent to users
    has recently received increased research interest. However, no common language
    has been established to systematize robot motion intent. This work presents a
    scoping review aimed at unifying existing knowledge. Based on our analysis, we
    present an intent communication model that depicts the relationship between robot
    and human through different intent dimensions (intent type, intent information,
    intent location). We discuss these different intent dimensions and their interrelationships
    with different kinds of robots and human roles. Throughout our analysis, we classify
    the existing research literature along our intent communication model, allowing
    us to identify key patterns and possible directions for future research.}"

    bend to follow human movements and vary the movement synchronization patterns.

  abstract: "{We present Kerfmeter, a hardware + software device that automatically
    determines how much material the laser cutter burns off, also known as kerf. Its
    knowledge about kerf allows Kerfmeter to make the joints of laser cut 3D models
    fit together with just the right tension, i.e., loose enough to allow for comfortable
    assembly, yet tight enough to hold parts together without glue—all this without
    user interaction. Kerfmeter attaches to the head of a laser cutter and works as
    follows: when users send a model to the laser cutter, Kerfmeter intercepts the
    job, injects a brief calibration routine that determines kerf, dilates the cutting
    plan according to this kerf, and then proceeds to fabricate the cutting plan.
    During the calibration routine, Kerfmeter cuts a 2cm Archimedean spiral and uses
    a motor to rotate it in place until it jams against the surrounding material;
    the angle at which the spiral jams allows Kerfmeter to infer kerf. The calibration
    process takes about 20s, which is >10x faster than traditional, manual kerf calibration,
    while also eliminating the need for expertise. In our technical evaluation, Kerfmeter
    produced functioning press fit joints reliably at a precision comparable to traditional
    manual kerf strips. Kerfmeter makes it easy to sample repeatedly; we demonstrate
    how this allows boosting precision past any traditional kerf strip.}"

    to bridge this distance, are not yet sufficient in providing a sense of social
    connection comparable to face-to-face interactions. Possible reasons are the limited
    multimodality of VR systems and the lack of non-verbal cues in VR avatars. We
    systematically investigated how facial expressions influence Social Presence in
    two collaborative VR tasks. We explored four types of facial expressions: eyes
    and mouth movements, their combination, and no expressions, for two types of explanations:
    verbal and graphical. To examine how these expressions influence Social Presence,
    we conducted a controlled VR experiment (N = 48), in which participants had to
    explain a specific term to their counterpart. Our results demonstrate that eye
    and mouth movements positively influence Social Presence in VR. Particularly,
    combining verbal explanations and eye movements induces the highest feeling of
    co-presence.}"

    a variety of memory aids (e.g., calendars). As we grow closer to mass adoption
    of everyday Extended Reality (XR), which is frequently leveraging perceptual limitations
    (e.g., redirected walking), it becomes pertinent to consider how XR could leverage
    memory limitations (forgetting, distorting, persistence) to induce memory manipulations.
    As memories highly impact our self-perception, social interactions, and behaviors,
    there is a pressing need to understand XR Memory Manipulations (XRMMs). We ran
    three speculative design workshops (n=12), with XR and memory researchers creating
    48 XRMM scenarios. Through thematic analysis, we define XRMMs, present a framework
    of their core components and reveal three classes (at encoding, pre-retrieval,
    at retrieval). Each class differs in terms of technology (AR, VR) and impact on
    memory (influencing quality of memories, inducing forgetting, distorting memories).
    We raise ethical concerns and discuss opportunities of perceptual and memory manipulations
    in XR.}"

    a worthy challenge and positive player experience, indicating long-term retention.
    Based on our findings, we present five design implications to guide future work:

    Using a within-subjects design, we invited 34 participants to take part in a mixed-methods
    evaluation of a gamified and non-gamified variant of the simulation that included
    questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Results show that gamification
    improved player experience and encouraged players to reflect on goal achievement

    techniques for point cloud alignment in 3D space, including visual feedback during
    alignment, and implemented a proof-of-concept prototype in the context of a surgical

    of irreversible interactions by contextualizing our work with critical HCI discourses
    and deducing three design strategies. Finally, we discuss irreversibility as a
    design element for self-reflection, meaningful acting, and a sustainable relationship
    with technology. While previously individual aspects of irreversibility have been

  abstract: "{Social media platforms use short, highly engaging videos to catch users’
    attention. While the short-form video feeds popularized by TikTok are rapidly
    spreading to other platforms, we do not yet understand their impact on cognitive
    functions. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 60) investigating the
    impact of engaging with TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube while performing a Prospective
    Memory task (i.e., executing a previously planned action). The study required
    participants to remember intentions over interruptions. We found that the TikTok
    condition significantly degraded the users’ performance in this task. As none
    of the other conditions (Twitter, YouTube, no activity) had a similar effect,
    our results indicate that the combination of short videos and rapid context-switching
    impairs intention recall and execution. We contribute a quantified understanding
    of the effect of social media feed format on Prospective Memory and outline consequences
    for media technology designers to not harm the users’ memory and wellbeing.}"

  abstract: "{Gestural interaction with freehands and while grasping an everyday object
    enables always-available input. To sense such gestures, minimal instrumentation

    IMU layout remains challenging, due to the complexity of the multi-factorial space
    that comprises diverse finger gestures, objects, and grasps. We present SparseIMU,
    a rapid method for selecting minimal inertial sensor-based layouts for effective
    gesture recognition. Furthermore, we contribute a computational tool to guide
    designers with optimal sensor placement. Our approach builds on an extensive microgestures
    dataset that we collected with a dense network of 17 inertial measurement units
    (IMUs). We performed a series of analyses, including an evaluation of the entire
    combinatorial space for freehand and grasping microgestures (393 K layouts), and
    quantified the performance across different layout choices, revealing new gesture
    detection opportunities with IMUs. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of
    our method with four scenarios.}"

    We found, among others, that the situated layout of virtual content in its environment

    we propose a two-dimensional design space to establish the vocabularies and detail
    their parameters for content organization. With our work, we aim to facilitate

    among others, judgements of aesthetics and usability. We tested our proposition
    in an experiment in which users rated screenshots of city websites. The aesthetic-usability
    effect was replicated by our data: aesthetics and usability correlated .79. When
    controlling for fluency, however, the aesthetic-usability effect was considerably

    wore for 8-10 days each. We investigated the effect of prolonged HWD use on the
    experience of the supervising anesthesiologists and their co-workers using interviews
    and repeated observations. A reflexive thematic analysis showed (1) interaction
    and mindset changes over time, (2) information on the HWD is more than numbers,
    (3) the HWD affects co-workers' collaboration with supervisors, and (4) distraction
    depends on the point of view. Using activity theory, we discuss the fact that
    HWD use develops and changes over time and that even a single-user HWD influences

  abstract: "{One way to counteract anthropogenic climate change, is to reduce individual
    energy consumption. An especially energy-intensive everyday practice is doing
    the laundry. In Germany, laundry accounts for about 5\\% of domestic electricity
    consumption. In part, this is because users do not make use of the energy-saving
    programs offered by modern washing machines. Based on different principles of
    behavior change, we created four concepts for washing machine interfaces to encourage
    users to choose energy-saving programs and settings. These concepts were implemented
    as functional prototypes. An online experiment (N=400) showed that all concepts
    increased the choice of energy-saving programs compared to a standard machine.
    Especially effective was to interrupt impulsive actions and suggest alternative
    choices (concept B) and to restructure the entry of settings (concept E). This
    demonstrates how small changes in a standard interfaces can significantly increase
    the probability of energy conservation in a private setting.}"

  abstract: "{With most digital devices, vibrotactile feedback consists of rhythmic
    patterns of continuous vibration. In contrast, when interacting with physical
    objects, we experience many of their material properties through vibration which
    is not continuous, but dynamically coupled to our actions. We assume the first
    style of vibration to lead to hermeneutic mediation, while the second style leads
    to embodied mediation. What if both types of mediation could be used to design
    tactile symbols? To investigate this, five haptic experts designed tactile symbols
    using continuous and motion-coupled vibration. Experts were interviewed to understand
    their symbols and design approach. A thematic analysis revealed themes showing
    that lived experience and affective qualities shaped design choices, that experts
    optimized for passive or active symbols, and that they considered context as part
    of the design. Our study suggests that adding embodied experiences as a design
    resource changes how participants think of tactile symbol design, thus broadening
    the scope of the symbol by design for context, and expanding their affective repertoire
    as changing the type of vibration influences perceived valence and arousal.}"

  abstract: "{Mid-air gestures, widely used in today’s Augmented Reality (AR) applications,
    are prone to the “gorilla arm” effect, leading to discomfort with prolonged interactions.
    While prior work has proposed metrics to quantify this effect and means to improve
    comfort and ergonomics, these works usually only consider simplistic, one-dimensional
    AR interactions, like reaching for a point or pushing a button. However, interacting
    with AR environments also involves far more complex tasks, such as rotational
    knobs, potentially impacting ergonomics. This paper advances the understanding
    of the ergonomics of rotational mid-air interactions in AR. For this, we contribute
    the results of a controlled experiment exposing the participants to a rotational
    task in the interaction space defined by their arms’ reach. Based on the results,
    we discuss how novel future mid-air gesture modalities benefit from our findings

  abstract: "{In today’s digitized societies, phishing attacks are a security threat
    with damaging consequences. Organizations remain vulnerable to phishing attacks,
    and it is not clear how the work context influences people’s perceptions and behaviors
    related to phishing attempts. I investigate (1) how contextual factors influence
    reactions to a spear-phishing attempt, (2) why people report or do not report
    phishing attempts, (3) which opportunities for security-enhancing interventions
    people identify. I use an in-situ deception methodology to observe participants
    (N=14) in their realistic work environment. I triangulate observational and self-reported
    data to obtain rich qualitative insights into participants’ emotions, thoughts,
    and actions when receiving a targeted phishing email. I find that task, IT, internal
    and social context play an important role. The email’s request being aligned with
    expectations and perceived time pressure when responding to emails were associated
    with insecure behavior. The social context positively influenced phishing detection,
    but “phished” participants did not tell anyone.}"

  abstract: "{In the design of social robots, the focus is often on the robot itself
    rather than on the intricacies of possible application scenarios. In this paper,
    we examine eight fictional documentaries about social robots, such as SEYNO, a
    robot that promotes respect between passengers in trains, or PATO, a robot to
    watch movies with. Overall, robots were conceptualized either (1) to substitute
    humans in relationships or (2) to mediate relationships (human-human-robot-interaction).
    While the former is basis of many current approaches to social robotics, the latter
    is less common, but particularly interesting. For instance, the mediation perspective
    fundamentally impacts the role a robot takes (e.g., role model, black sheep, ally,
    opponent, moralizer) and thus its potential function and form. From the substitution
    perspective, robots are expected to mimic human emotions; from the mediation perspective,
    robots can be positive precisely because they remain objective and are neither
    emotional nor empathic.}"

    Our results showed that the belief of receiving adaptive AI support increases

    indicated by the number of solved word puzzles. We integrate our findings into

    The S-BAN is a new handheld haptic interface that utilizes a parallel kinematic
    structure to deliver 2-DOF spatial information over a continuous workspace, with
    a form factor suited to integration with other travel aids. The ability to pivot,
    extend and retract its body opens possibilities and questions around spatial data
    representation. We present a static study to understand user perception of absolute
    pose and relative motion for two spatial mappings, showing the highest sensitivity
    to relative motions in the cardinal directions. We then present an embodied navigation
    experiment in virtual reality (VR). User motion efficiency when guided by the
    S-BAN was statistically equivalent to using a vision-based tool (a smartphone

    were more elevated with the S-BAN, allowing greater visual focus on the environment.}"

    which limits the potential of walking meetings. To address this, we designed the

    We investigated our system in a three-condition between-subjects user study with
    thirty pairs of participants (N=60) who conducted 15-minute outdoor walking meetings.
    Participants either used clip-on microphones, the prototype without the button,
    or the prototype with the highlighting button. We found that the tangible device
    increased task focus, and the physical highlighting button facilitated turn-taking
    and resulted in more useful notes. Our work demonstrates how interactive artifacts
    can incentivize users to hold meetings in motion and enhance conversation dynamics.

    the addition of thermal feedback. We present ThermalPen, a novel pen for 3D sketching
    that associates the texture and colour of strokes with different thermal properties.
    For example, a fire texture elicits an increase in temperature, while an ice texture
    causes a temperature drop in the pen. Our goal with ThermalPen is to enhance the
    3D sketching experience and allow users to use this tool to increase their creativity
    while sketching. We plan on evaluating the influence of thermal feedback on the
    3D sketching experience, with a focus on user creativity in the future.}"

    Consequently, interaction designers cannot decide which gestures to use for which

    agenda in this area, based on an analysis of 172 papers. As part of our analysis,
    we clustered gestures according to the dimensions of an existing taxonomy to identify
    their common characteristics in different domains, and we investigated the extent
    to which existing mid-air gesture sets are consistent across different domains.
    We derived a consensus gesture set containing 22 gestures based on agreement rates

  abstract: "{Virtual tourism products promise to combine the best of two worlds:
    Staying in the safety of one’s home while having engaging tourism experiences.
    Previous tourism research has emphasised that tourism experiences involve more
    than just seeing other places. They address cultural motives such as novelty and
    education and socio-psychological motives like relaxation, escape from a mundane
    environment or facilitation of social interaction. We suggest applying the motive-oriented
    perspective in HCI research on virtual tourism and report on a corresponding analysis
    of 21 virtual tourism products. Our findings show that current virtual tourism
    products neglect the breadth of tourist motives. They mainly focus on cultural
    motives while rarely addressing socio-psychological motives, especially kinship
    relationships and prestige. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of the motive-oriented
    perspective for HCI and inspired conceptual ideas for addressing motives in virtual
    tourism products that may be useful for future research and design in this area.}"

    to enable social interactions at a distance. Yet it is still relatively unknown
    if and to what extent such applications provide meaningful social experiences
    in cases where in-person leisure activities are not feasible. To explore this,
    we developed a custom social VR application and conducted an exploratory lab study
    with 25 dyads in which we compared an in-person and a virtual version of a co-located
    multiplayer scenario. Our mixed-methods analysis revealed that both scenarios
    created a socially rich atmosphere and strengthened the social closeness between
    players. However, the lack of facial animations, limited body language, and a
    low field of view led to VR’s main social experiential limitations: a reduced
    mutual awareness and emotional understanding compared to the in-person scenario.
    We derive implications for social VR design and research as well as game user
    research.}"

    a bicycle (bikeless), (2) cycling on a fixed (stationary) and (3) moving bicycle
    (tandem) with four levels of control (no control, steering, pedaling, and steering
    + pedaling). To evaluate all combinations of fidelity and control, we conducted
    a controlled experiment (N = 24) in indoor and outdoor settings. We found that
    the bikeless setup provides the highest feeling of safety, while the tandem leads
    to the highest realism without increasing motion sickness. Moreover, we discovered
    that bicycles are not essential for cycling in VR.}"

    While DES is well-studied in computer displays, its impact on users of virtual

    of their key properties (e.g., the vergence-accommodation conflict) make VR-HMDs
    particularly prone. This work provides the first comprehensive investigation into
    DES in VR HMDs. We present results from a survey with 68 experienced users to
    understand DES symptoms in VR-HMDs. To help address DES, we investigate eye exercises

  abstract: "{In human-computer interaction (HCI), there has been a push towards open
    science, but to date, this has not happened consistently for HCI research utilizing
    brain signals due to unclear guidelines to support reuse and reproduction. To
    understand existing practices in the field, this paper examines 110 publications,
    exploring domains, applications, modalities, mental states and processes, and
    more. This analysis reveals variance in how authors report experiments, which
    creates challenges to understand, reproduce, and build on that research. It then
    describes an overarching experiment model that provides a formal structure for
    reporting HCI research with brain signals, including definitions, terminology,
    categories, and examples for each aspect. Multiple distinct reporting styles were
    identified through factor analysis and tied to different types of research. The
    paper concludes with recommendations and discusses future challenges. This creates
    actionable items from the abstract model and empirical observations to make HCI
    research with brain signals more reproducible and reusable.}"

    presence, and so is virtual reality (VR) by increasing immersion, engagement,
    motivation, and interest of students. Nevertheless, there is a research gap if
    the benefits of pair-learning and VR can be combined. Furthermore, it is not clear
    which influence it has if only one or both peers use VR. To investigate these
    aspects, we implemented two types of VR pair-learning systems, a symmetric system
    with both peers using VR and an asymmetric system with one using a tablet. In
    a user study (N=46), the symmetric system statistically significantly provided
    higher presence, immersion, player experience, and lower intrinsic cognitive load,
    which are all important for learning. Symmetric and asymmetric systems performed
    equally well regarding learning outcome, highlighting that both are valuable learning
    systems. We used these findings to define guidelines on how to design co-located
    VR pair-learning applications, including characteristics for symmetric and asymmetric

    continuum enables adapting and manipulating the sense of agency and involvement
    in the virtual world. This flexibility of perspectives broadens the design space
    of VR experiences through deliberately manipulating perception. In a study, we
    explore users’ attitudes, experiences and perceptions while controlling a virtual

    work, we conducted an experiment (N=31) assessing how the perception of roughness

    effects of different visualizations on the perception of physical textures with
    distinct roughnesses. Additionally, we used the visualizations’ real-world materials,

    smart home controls into furniture such as sofas. While the technical aspects
    of such controllers have been the subject of numerous research projects, the physical
    form factor of these controls has received little attention so far. This work
    investigates how general design properties, such as overall slider shape, raised
    vs. recessed sliders, and number and layout of tick marks, affect users’ preferences
    and performance. Our first user study identified a preference for certain design
    combinations, such as recessed, closed-shaped sliders. Our second user study included
    performance measurements on variations of the preferred designs from study&nbsp;1,
    and took a closer look at tick marks. Tick marks supported orientation better
    than slider shape. Sliders with at least three tick marks were preferred, and
    performed well. Non-uniform, equally distributed tick marks reduced the movements
    users needed to orient themselves on the slider.}"

    for geometry, and not necessarily precise labels, while coupling the search process
    to the physical environment (e.g., by sketching in-situ, extracting search terms
    from objects present, or tracing them). We developed ShapeFindAR for HoloLens

    setups and their attitudes toward remote participation. We then identified different
    approaches to running remote studies and conducted two case studies for an in-depth

    tools have recently emerged to support such analysis in situ, yet the complexity

    ReLive: a mixed-immersion visual analytics framework for exploring and analyzing
    mixed reality user studies. ReLive combines an in-situ virtual reality view with
    a complementary ex-situ desktop view. While the virtual reality view allows users
    to relive interactive spatial recordings replicating the original study, the synchronized
    desktop view provides a familiar interface for analyzing aggregated data. We validated
    our concepts in a two-step evaluation consisting of a design walkthrough and an
    empirical expert user study.}"

    current solutions still create mismatches between the visuals and physical movement,
    which causes VR sickness and diminishes the cycling experience. To reduce VR sickness
    in bicycle simulators, we conducted two controlled lab experiments addressing
    two main causes of VR sickness: (1) steering methods and (2) cycling trajectory.
    In the first experiment (N = 18) we compared handlebar, HMD, and upper-body steering
    methods. In the second experiment (N = 24) we explored three types of movement
    in VR (1D, 2D, and 3D trajectories) and three countermeasures (airflow, vibration,
    and dynamic Field-of-View) to reduce VR sickness. We found that handlebar steering
    leads to the lowest VR sickness without decreasing cycling performance and airflow
    suggests to be the most promising method to reduce VR sickness for all three types
    of trajectories.}"

    When participants approached six virtual agents (i.e., two males, two females,
    a humanoid robot, and a pillar) to ask for directions, we found that participants
    respected the agents’ PS and modulated interpersonal distances according to the
    human-like agents’ perceived gender. When participants were instructed to walk
    through the agents, we observed heightened skin-conductance levels that indicate

    amused by and played with our cartoonish cat robot or simply tolerated its presence.

    them in ONYX. In order to trigger reflections and gain feedback on possible design

    become associated with certain stages of life and disappear thereafter. Noting
    the expanding body of literature within HCI about appropriation, our work pinpoints
    an area that needs more attention, “outdated technologies.” In other words, we
    assert that design practices can profit as much from imaginaries of the future
    as they can from reassessing artefacts from the past in a critical way. In a two-week
    fieldwork with 37 HCI students, we gathered an international collection of nostalgic
    devices from 14 different countries to investigate what memories people still
    have of older technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal normative
    and accidental use of technological objects. We found that participants primarily
    remembered older technologies with positive connotations and shared memories of
    how they had adapted and appropriated these technologies, rather than normative
    uses. We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the future, we
    would like to develop this concept further by discussing how nostalgic reminiscence
    can be operationalized to stimulate speculative design in the present.}"

    how the autonomous design of a VE can affect emotional engagement and well-being.
    We present Mood Worlds – a VR application allowing users to visualise their emotions

    Worlds is an effective tool supporting emotional engagement. Additionally, we
    found that an autonomous creation process in VR increases positive emotions and

    everyone to take countermeasures such as wearing masks or disinfecting their hands.
    However, while previous work suggests that these countermeasures may profoundly
    impact biometric authentication, an investigation of the actual impact is still
    missing. Hence, in this work, we present our findings from an online survey (n=334)
    on experienced changes in device usage and failures of authentication. Our results
    show significant changes in personal and shared device usage, as well as a significant
    increase in experienced failures when comparing the present situation to before
    the Covid-19 pandemic. From our qualitative analysis of participants’ responses,
    we derive potential reasons for these changes in device usage and increases in
    authentication failures. Our findings suggest that making authentication contactless
    is only one of the aspects relevant to encounter the novel challenges caused by
    the pandemic.}"

    styles: two differing short keyword-based response styles and a full-sentence

    requests. Results show that the short responses were perceived similarly useful

    more realistic has become a strong focus of research in recent years. The resulting
    haptic feedback systems differ greatly in their technologies, feedback possibilities,

    the Haptic Fidelity Framework providing the means to describe, understand and
    compare haptic feedback systems. The framework locates a system in the spectrum
    of providing realistic or abstract haptic feedback using the Haptic Fidelity dimension.
    It comprises 14 criteria that either describe foundational or limiting factors.
    A second Versatility dimension captures the current trade-off between highly realistic
    but application-specific and more abstract but widely applicable feedback. To
    validate the framework, we compared the Haptic Fidelity score to the perceived
    feedback realism of evaluations from 38 papers and found a strong correlation
    suggesting the framework accurately describes the realism of haptic feedback.}"

    partly mitigates this by enabling more goal-directed interaction. However, we
    found no evidence of faster or more accurate task performance. This indicates
    a tradeoff between feedforward detail and implied cognitive costs, such as attention.
    Moreover, we found that visualizations alone are not always sufficient for users
    to understand individual control dimensions. Our study quantifies fundamental
    UI design factors and resulting interaction behavior in this context, revealing

    attention feedback for remote meetings. In a four-week study, two student groups
    worked remotely on course assignments using EyeMeet. Our findings of the study

  abstract: "{Automated vehicles are expected to substitute driver-pedestrian communication
    via LED strips or displays. This communication is expected to improve trust and
    the crossing process in general. However, numerous factors such as other pedestrians’
    behavior, perceived time pressure, or previous experience influence crossing decisions.
    Therefore, we report the results of a triply subdivided Virtual Reality study
    (N=18) evaluating these. Results show that external communication was perceived
    as hedonically pleasing, increased perceived safety and trust, and also that pedestrians’
    behavior affected participants’ behavior. A timer did not alter crossing behavior,
    however, repeated exposure increased trust and reduced crossing times, showing
    a habituation effect. Our work helps better to integrate research on external
    communication in ecologically valid settings.}"

    this increased popularity brings its challenges. In particular, the accident rates
    for E-Scooter riders increase, which endangers the riders and other road users.
    In this paper, we explore the idea of augmenting E-Scooters with unimodal warnings
    to prevent collisions with other road users, which include Augmented Reality (AR)
    notifications, vibrotactile feedback on the handlebar, and auditory signals in
    the AR glasses. We conducted an outdoor experiment (N = 13) using an Augmented
    Reality simulation and compared these types of warnings in terms of reaction time,
    accident rate, and feeling of safety. Our results indicate that AR and auditory
    warnings lead to shorter reaction times, have a better perception, and create
    a better feeling of safety than vibrotactile warnings. Moreover, auditory signals
    have a higher acceptance by the riders compared to the other two types of warnings.}"

    results were inconclusive. Further, we identified a significant difference between
    (un)restricted movement trajectories. Our data shows considerable differences

    we designed two visualizations that: (1) highlight occluded cars through an X-ray

    a Countdown. To investigate the efficiency of these visualizations, we proposed
    an Augmented Reality simulation as a novel evaluation method, in which the above

    a need for authentication. However, it is unclear if and how smart home visitors
    should authenticate as they usually do not have access to respective interfaces.
    We explore considerations for the design of authentication for visitors evolving
    around, e.g., the visitors themselves as well as the environment and concrete
    mechanisms. Moreover, we suggest a concrete idea: security questions to authenticate
    visitors in smart homes. In an interview study (N = 24), we found that owners
    and visitors appreciated the low effort and would adapt our approach. We conclude
    with future research directions that we hope will spark further discussions around
    the design of authentication for smart homes, considering visitors and owners
    alike.}"

  abstract: "{Home assistants are becoming a widespread product, but they mostly come
    as a compact device and offer very few customization and personalization features,
    which often leads to dissatisfaction. With the technological advancements, these
    systems are becoming more adaptable to the users’ needs and can better imitate
    a human personality. To achieve that efficiently, understanding how different
    users envision their desired assistant is crucial. To identify people’s customization
    and personalization preferences and their desired personality for a home assistant,
    we designed a set of storyboards depicting a variety of possible features in a
    domestic setting and conducted a user study (), including a series of semi-structured
    interviews. Our quantitative results suggest that users prefer an agent which
    is highly agreeable and has higher conscientiousness and emotional stability.
    Furthermore, we discuss users’ customization and personalization preferences for
    a home assistant, which could be considered when designing the future generation
    of home assistants.}"

    anticipatory error handling for a voice-controlled video game where the game would
    perform a locally optimized action in respect to goal completion and obstacle
    avoidance, when a command is not recognized. We evaluated the user experience
    of our approach versus traditional, repetition-based error handling (). Our results
    indicate that implementing anticipatory error handling can improve the usability
    of a system, if it follows the intention of the user. Otherwise, it impairs the

    whether the code reading behaviour of developers differs between code that uses

    is a consequence of differences in both syntax and semantics of the code. This

    an online study (N=352) on the severity and relevance of all three symptom categories.
    Most importantly, our results reveal that symptoms of simulator sickness are significantly
    less severe and of lower prevalence than those of DES and ergonomics. In light

  abstract: "{Recent automotive research often focuses on automated driving, including
    the interaction between automated vehicles (AVs) and so-called “vulnerable road
    users” (VRUs). While road safety statistics and traffic psychology at least define
    VRUs as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, many publications on human-vehicle
    interaction use the term without even defining it. The actual target group remains
    unclear. Since each group already poses a broad spectrum of research challenges,
    a one-fits-all solution seems unrealistic and inappropriate, and a much clearer
    differentiation is required. To foster clarity and comprehensibility, we propose
    a literature-based taxonomy providing a structured separation of (vulnerable)
    road users, designed to particularly (but not exclusively) support research on
    the communication between VRUs and AVs. It consists of two conceptual hierarchies
    and will help practitioners and researchers by providing a uniform and comparable

  abstract: '{We present Assembler3 a software tool that allows users to perform 3D
    parametric manipulations on 2D laser cutting plans. Assembler3 achieves this by
    semi-automatically converting 2D laser cutting plans to 3D, where users modify
    their models using available 3D tools (kyub), before converting them back to 2D.
    In our user study, this workflow allowed users to modify models 10x faster than
    using the traditional approach of editing 2D cutting plans directly. Assembler3
    converts models to 3D in 5 steps: (1) plate detection, (2) joint detection, (3)
    material thickness detection, (4) joint matching based on hashed joint "signatures",
    and (5) interactive reconstruction. In our technical evaluation, Assembler3 was
    able to reconstruct 100 of 105 models. Once 3D-reconstructed, we expect users
    to store and share their models in 3D, which can simplify collaboration and thereby
    empower the laser cutting community to create models of higher complexity.}'

    Facilitating robot teleoperation by providing additional visual information about

    tasks. Our results show performance improvements in different levels, reflecting
    in objective and subjective measures with trade-offs in terms of time, accuracy,

    in-situ guidance assists creating valid on-body circuits and aesthetic ornaments

    and non-inking creates error preventing constraints. We contribute BodyStylus’s
    design rationale and interaction concept along with an interactive prototype that
    uses self-sintering conductive ink. Results of two focus group explorations showed
    that guidance was more appreciated by artists, while constraints appeared more

  abstract: "{Emerging research has demonstrated the viability of on-textile actuation
    mechanisms, however, an easily customizable and versatile on-cloth actuation mechanism
    is yet to be explored. In this paper, we present ClothTiles along with its rapid
    fabrication technique that enables actuation of clothes. ClothTiles leverage flexible
    3D-printing and Shape-Memory Alloys (SMAs) alongside new parametric actuation
    designs. We validate the concept of fabric actuation using a base element, and
    then systematically explore methods of aggregating, scaling, and orienting prospects
    for extended actuation in garments. A user study demonstrated that our technique
    enables multiple actuation types applied across a variety of clothes. Users identified
    both aesthetic and functional applications of ClothTiles. We conclude with a number
    of insights for the Do-It-Yourself community on how to employ 3D-printing with
    SMAs to enable actuation on clothes.}"

  abstract: "{Augmented Reality (AR) is increasingly being used for providing guidance
    and supporting troubleshooting in industrial settings. While the general application
    of AR has been shown to provide clear benefits regarding physical tasks, it is
    important to understand how different visualization types influence user’s performance
    during the execution of the tasks. Previous studies evaluating AR and user’s performance
    compared different media types or types of AR hardware as opposed to different
    types of visualization for the same hardware type. This paper provides details
    of our comparative study in which we identified the influence of visualization
    types on the performance of complex machine set-up processes. Although our results
    show clear advantages to using concrete rather than abstract visualizations, we
    also find abstract visualizations coupled with videos leads to similar user performance
    as with concrete visualizations.}"

    they can also cause an initial feeling of unease in users. It is important for
    Human-Computer Interaction to manage first impressions and avoid designing technologies
    that appear creepy. To that end, we developed the Perceived Creepiness of Technology
    Scale (PCTS), which measures how creepy a technology appears to a user in an initial
    encounter with a new artefact. The scale was developed based on past work on creepiness
    and a set of ten focus groups conducted with users from diverse backgrounds. We
    followed a structured process of analytically developing and validating the scale.
    The PCTS is designed to enable designers and researchers to quickly compare interactive
    technologies and ensure that they do not design technologies that produce initial
    feelings of creepiness in users.}"

    creators fulfill four roles: concept developers, interaction designers, content

    and faces a variety of challenges during the design process from the initial contextual
    analysis to the deployment. From analysis of their tool sets, methods, and artifacts,

    perception of the vehicle’s detection capabilities (and its failures) while only
    inducing a low cognitive load. Additionally, the simultaneously raised situation
    awareness could benefit potential take-overs. We report the results of two comparative
    online studies on visualizing semantic segmentation information for the human
    user of autonomous vehicles. Effects on trust, cognitive load, and situation awareness
    were measured using a simulation (N=32) and state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation

    social aspects of conversation, implied VA capabilities, and the influence of
    user personality. The majority envisioned dialogues with a VA that is interactive
    and not purely functional; it is smart, proactive, and has knowledge about the
    user. Attitudes diverged regarding the assistant’s role as well as it expressing
    humour and opinions. An exploratory analysis suggested a relationship with personality
    for these aspects, but correlations were low overall. We discuss implications

  abstract: "{The piano keyboard offers a significant range and polyphony for well-trained
    pianists. Yet, apart from dynamics, the piano is incapable of translating expressive
    movements such as vibrato onto the played note. Adding sound effects requires
    additional modalities. A pitch wheel can be found on the side of most electric
    pianos. To add a vibrato or pitch bend, the pianist needs to actively operate
    the pitch wheel with their hand, which requires cognitive effort and may disrupt
    play. In this work, we present EMPiano, a system that allows pianists to incorporate
    a soft pitch vibrato into their play seamlessly. Vibrato can be triggered through
    muscle activity and is recognized via electromyography. This allows EMPiano to
    integrate into piano play. Our system offers new interaction opportunities with
    the piano to increase the player’s potential for expressive play. In this paper,
    we contribute the open-source implementation and the workflow behind EMPiano.}"

    Besides visual and auditory feedback, other senses like haptics, smell and taste

    this need, researchers conceptualized approaches leveraging everyday physical

    environments and conditions, however, poses significant challenges to a variety
    of disciplines such as HCI, VR, haptics, tracking, perceptual science, design,

    feedback in virtual experiences and sets course for respective future research
    endeavors. Since the community still seems to lack a cohesive agenda for advancing

  abstract: "{Augmented Reality (AR) glasses equip users with the tools to modify
    the visual appearance of their surrounding environment. This might severely impact
    interpersonal communication, as the conversational partners will no longer share
    the same visual perception of reality. Grounded in color-in-context theory, we
    present a potential AR application scenario in which users can modify the color
    of the environment to achieve subconscious benefits. In a consecutive online survey
    (N=64), we measured the user’s comfort, acceptance of altering and being altered,
    and how it is impacted by being able to perceive or not perceive the alteration.
    We identified significant differences depending on (1) who or what is the target
    of the alteration, (2) which body part is altered, and (3) which relationship
    the conversational partners share. In light of our quantitative and qualitative
    findings, we discuss ethical and practical implications for future devices and
    applications that employ visual alterations.}"

    it is unclear whether current emotion detection methods detect such acted emotions
    properly, or rather the true emotion of the speaker. We asked a small number of
    participants (26) to mimic five basic emotions and used an open source emotion-in-voice
    detector to provide feedback on whether their acted emotion was recognized as
    intended. We found that it was difficult for participants to mimic all five emotions
    and that certain emotions were easier to mimic than others. However, it remains
    unclear whether this is due to the fact that emotion was only acted or due to
    the insufficiency of the detection software. As an intended side effect, we collected
    a small corpus of labeled data for acted emotion in speech, which we plan to extend
    and eventually use as training data for our own emotion detection. We present
    the study setup and discuss some insights on our results.}"

    fastForce achieves real-time performance (106x faster than finite element analysis,
    in the specific case of the wheelbarrow from Figure 1). This allows fastForce
    to fix structural issues continuously in the background, while users stay focused
    on editing their models and without ever becoming aware of any structural issues.In
    our study, six of seven participants inadvertently introduced severe structural
    flaws into the guitar stands they designed. Similarly, we found 286 of 402 relevant
    models in the kyub [1] model library to contain such flaws. We integrated fastForce

    differences in a person’s capability or the user interface) and resulting interdependence
    between players to create engagement even when one player has no access to a head-mounted

    now, it remains unclear whether and how an asymmetric game design with interdependences
    creates comparably enjoyable PX for both an HMD and a non-HMD player. In this
    work, we designed and implemented an asymmetric VR game (different in its user
    interface) with two types of interdependence: strategic (difference in game information/player
    capability) and biometric (difference in player’s biometric influence). Our mixed-methods
    user study (N=30) shows that asymmetries positively impact PX for both player
    roles, that interdependence strongly affects players’ perception of agency, and
    that biometric feedback—while subjective—is a valuable game mechanic.}"

    We demonstrate how exhibits’ physical configuration and interactive control engendered

    differently amongst visitors. We present four mechanisms for how control can be

    control influence patterns of shared interaction with the exhibits and social

    and the prevalence of direct analysis of audiovisual recordings. We found that
    a key task was locating and analyzing inspectables, interesting segments in recordings.
    Since locating inspectables can be time consuming, participants look for detectables,

    We review related literature to converge to word-level text entry by analysis
    of gaze paths that are temporally constrained by humming. We develop and evaluate
    two design choices: “HumHum” and “Hummer.” The first method requires short hums
    to indicate the start and end of a word. The second method interprets one continuous
    humming as an indication of the start and end of a word. In an experiment with

    4.0 environment. Our basic perceptual research focuses on both the visual complexity
    of backgrounds as well as the influence of a secondary task. In contrast to our
    expectation, data of our 34 study participants indicate that the background has
    far less influence on the perception of AR visualizations. Moreover, we observed
    a mismatch between measured and subjectively reported performance. We discuss
    the importance of the background and recommendations for visual real-world augmentations.

  abstract: "{Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize our workspaces,
    since it considerably extends the limits of current displays while keeping users
    aware of their collaborators and surroundings. Collective activities like brainstorming
    and sensemaking often use space for arranging documents and information and thus
    will likely benefit from AR-enhanced offices. Until now, there has been very little
    research on how the physical surroundings might affect virtual content placement
    for collaborative sensemaking. We therefore conducted an initial study with eight
    participants in which we compared two different room settings for collaborative
    image categorization regarding content placement, spatiality, and layout. We found
    that participants tend to utilize the room’s vertical surfaces as well as the
    room’s furniture, particularly through edges and gaps, for placement and organization.
    We also identified three different spatial layout patterns (panoramic-strip, semi-cylindrical
    layout, furniture-based distribution) and observed the usage of temporary storage
    spaces specifically for collaboration.}"

    the limited expressiveness of touch input. While research has suggested many approaches
    to detect tangibles, the corresponding tangibles are either costly or have a considerable
    minimal size. This makes them bulky and unattractive for many applications. At
    the same time, they obscure valuable display space for interaction. To address
    these shortcomings, we contribute Itsy-Bits: a fabrication pipeline for 3D printing
    and recognition of tangibles on capacitive touchscreens with a footprint as small
    as a fingertip. Each Itsy-Bit consists of an enclosing 3D object and a unique
    conductive 2D shape on its bottom. Using only raw data of commodity capacitive
    touchscreens, Itsy-Bits reliably identifies and locates a variety of shapes in
    different sizes and estimates their orientation. Through example applications
    and a technical evaluation, we demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of
    Itsy-Bits for tangibles with small footprints.}"

    collected through in-depth interviews with professional guitarists and teachers.
    In a user study (N=24), we evaluated the feedback modules of Let’s Frets against
    fretboard charts. Our results show that visual indicators require the least time
    to realize new finger positions while a combination of visual indicators and position
    capturing yielded the highest playing accuracy. We conclude how Let’s Frets enables

    and the needs of target groups that have not been sufficiently considered in the
    past. In this paper, we present the findings from a qualitative study (N=11) of
    public attitude on hypothetical implementation scenarios for AVs. Our results
    indicate that people are aware of the benefits of shared mobility for the environment
    and society, and are generally open to using it. However, 1) emotional factors
    mitigate this openness and 2) security concerns were expressed by female participants.
    We recommend that identified concerns must be addressed to allow AVs fully exploiting
    their benefits for society and environment.}"

    the app also discloses each person’s current sharing settings to the partner.
    In a 16-day field study, four couples interacted with our app and the disclosed
    configurations, confirming the disclosure’s positive effect on transparency. However,
    features obfuscating the location were considered superfluous, as participants
    preferred sharing their location exactly or not at all. While participants overall
    appreciated having the configuration options, changes in their partners’ configurations

    as a design material, we investigate four design research case studies involving
    ML. We derive three provocative concepts: thingly uncertainty: ML-driven artefacts
    have uncertain, variable relations to their environments; pattern leakage: ML
    uncertainty can lead to patterns shaping the world they are meant to represent;
    and futures creep: ML technologies texture human relations to time with uncertainty.

  abstract: "{3D printing has revolutionized rapid prototyping by speeding up the
    creation of custom-shaped objects. With the rise of multi-material 3D printers,
    these custom-shaped objects can now be made interactive in a single pass through
    passive conductive structures. However, connecting conventional electronics to
    these conductive structures often still requires time-consuming manual assembly
    involving many wires, soldering or gluing. To alleviate these shortcomings, we
    propose : a fabrication pipeline and interfacing concept to magnetically connect
    a 3D-printed object equipped with passive sensing structures to conventional sensing
    electronics. To this end, utilizes ferromagnetic and conductive 3D-printed structures,
    printable in a single pass on standard printers. We further present a proof-of-concept
    capacitive sensing board that enables easy and robust magnetic assembly to quickly
    create interactive 3D-printed objects. We evaluate by assessing the robustness
    and quality of the connection and demonstrate its broad applicability by a series
    of example applications.}"

    work within our academic communities, and (3) problems of social justice that
    exist within our academic communities. Building on our own experiences, practices
    and existing literature from a variety of disciplines we advocate for the possibility
    of an activist-academic practice, outline possible ways forward and formulate
    questions we need to answer for HCI to contribute to a more just world.}"

    explore presence and its dynamics across the real and digital worlds in everyday

    experience rather than performance. We will explore how interactive systems enhance
    sports experience without distracting from the actual goal of the athlete, such
    as freeing the mind. We will focus on several topics of interest such as sensory

    to exercises. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with 24 participants to investigate
    the effect of avatars’ athleticism on heart rate and perceived exertion while
    cycling in VR following a standardized protocol. We found that the avatars’ athleticism

    personal devices, could provide a platform for accessible, flexible, and unobtrusive
    integration of haptic feedback into mid-air gesture interaction. We prototyped
    a vibrotactile wrist band with four vibration actuators aiming at communicating
    invisible, undetectable virtual object properties such as electricity, weight,
    and tension into 3D haptic experiences. In this paper, we present findings from
    a user study (n=18) that examined the suitability of different vibration patterns
    (variation in intensity, temporal profile, rhythm, and location). Results show
    that all feedback variants have a positive impact on user experience (UX) when

    to avoid accessing such areas or not to disclose certain information. We built
    two prototypes: a) a mobile application capable of detecting smart devices in
    the environment using a thermal camera, and b) VR mockups of six scenarios where
    PriView might be useful (e.g., a rental apartment). In both, we included several

    a novel RE approach able to discover diverse layout types and their dynamic resizing
    behaviours independently of their implementation, and to specify them by using
    OR constraints. Unlike previous RE approaches, ReverseORC infers flexible layout
    constraint specifications by sampling UIs at different sizes and analyzing the
    differences between them. It can create specifications that replicate even some
    non-standard layout managers with complex dynamic layout behaviours. We demonstrate
    that ReverseORC works across different platforms with very different layout approaches,
    e.g., for GUIs as well as for the Web. Furthermore, it can be used to detect and
    fix problems in legacy UIs, extend UIs with enhanced layout behaviours, and support

  abstract: "{While advances in mobile text entry enable smartphone users to type
    almost as fast as on hardware keyboards, text-heavy activities are still not widely
    adopted. One reason is the lack of shortcut mechanisms. In this article, we determine
    shortcuts for text-heavy activities, elicit shortcut gestures, implement them
    for a fully touch-sensitive smartphone, and conduct an evaluation with potential
    users. We found that experts perform around 800 keyboard shortcuts per day, which
    are not available on smartphones. Interviews revealed the lack of shortcuts as
    a major limitation that prevents mobile text editing. Therefore, we elicited gestures
    for the 22 most important shortcuts for smartphones that are touch-sensitive on
    the whole device surface. We implemented the gestures for a fully touch-sensitive
    smartphone using deep learning and evaluated them in realistic scenarios to gather
    feedback. We show that the developed prototype is perceived as intuitive and faster
    than recent commercial approaches.}"

  abstract: "{Using microgestures, prior work has successfully enabled gestural interactions
    while holding objects. Yet, these existing methods are prone to false activations
    caused by natural finger movements while holding or manipulating the object. We
    address this issue with SoloFinger, a novel concept that allows design of microgestures
    that are robust against movements that naturally occur during primary activities.
    Using a data-driven approach, we establish that single-finger movements are rare
    in everyday hand-object actions and infer a single-finger input technique resilient
    to false activation. We demonstrate this concept’s robustness using a white-box
    classifier on a pre-existing dataset comprising 36 everyday hand-object actions.
    Our findings validate that simple SoloFinger gestures can relieve the need for
    complex finger configurations or delimiting gestures and that SoloFinger is applicable
    to diverse hand-object actions. Finally, we demonstrate SoloFinger’s high performance
    on commodity hardware using random forest classifiers.}"

    other prop), extract only the relevant parts, and directly place and transform
    these recordings in their physical environment. We describe the design and implementation

    Yet, to date, studies only investigated force input on rigid surfaces. We present
    a first systematic evaluation of the effects of compliance on force input. Results
    of a visual targeting task for three levels of softness indicate that high force
    levels appear more demanding for soft surfaces, but that performance is otherwise
    similar. Performance remained very high (∼ 5\\% for 20 force levels) regardless
    of the compliance, suggesting force input was underestimated so far. We infer
    implications for the design of force input on soft surfaces and conclude that
    interaction models used on rigid surfaces might be used on soft surfaces.}"

  abstract: "{Recent research in the area of immersive analytics demonstrated the
    utility of head-mounted augmented reality devices for visual data analysis. However,
    it can be challenging to use the by default supported mid-air gestures to interact
    with visualizations in augmented reality (e.g. due to limited precision). Touch-based
    interaction (e.g. via mobile devices) can compensate for these drawbacks, but
    is limited to two-dimensional input. In this work we present STREAM: Spatially-aware
    Tablets combined with Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Displays for the multimodal
    interaction with 3D visualizations. We developed a novel eyes-free interaction
    concept for the seamless transition between the tablet and the augmented reality
    environment. A user study reveals that participants appreciated the novel interaction
    concept, indicating the potential for spatially-aware tablets in augmented reality.
    Based on our findings, we provide design insights to foster the application of
    spatially-aware touch devices in augmented reality and research implications indicating
    areas that need further investigation.}"

    review of recent publications that empirically investigated social presence in
    cooperative AR. After a thorough selection procedure, we analyzed 19&nbsp;publications
    according to factors influencing social presence and the impact of social presence
    on cooperation support. We found that certain interventions support social presence
    better than others, that social presence has an influence on user's preferences
    and that the relation between social presence and cooperation quality may depend
    on the symmetry of the cooperation task. This contributes to existing research
    by clarifying the role of social presence for cooperative AR and deriving corresponding
    design recommendations.}"

    a user reflect is still complex. This makes it difficult to compare artefacts
    (or prototypes) for reflection, impeding future design efforts. To address this
    issue, we developed the Technology-Supported Reflection Inventory (TSRI), which
    is a scale that evaluates how effectively a system supports reflection. We first
    created a list of possible scale items based on past work in defining reflection.
    The items were then reviewed by experts. Next, we performed exploratory factor
    analysis to reduce the scale to its final length of nine items. Subsequently,
    we confirmed test-retest validity of our instrument, as well as its construct
    validity. The TSRI enables researchers and practitioners to compare prototypes

    Moreover, we investigate the role of users’ physiology in behavioral biometrics

    algorithms to enable a user to tactilely explore immersive virtual environments.
    We evaluate rudimentary 1-DOF, moderate 3-DOF, and complex 6-DOF tactile feedback
    during shape discrimination and mass discrimination, also comparing to interactions
    with real objects. Results from 20 naive study participants show that higher-dimensional

  abstract: "{Agility is the ability to change your body’s position in a fast and
    efficient way while maintaining control of speed and direction. To develop this
    skill, the use of agility ladders is a widespread and well-known training method.
    While drills vary, having a human expert explaining and monitoring the exercises
    is usually advantageous. So far, only a few approaches to interactive systems
    for agility ladder training have been presented. In this work, we propose an interactive
    projection system to support an athlete in performing those drills. To investigate
    the effects of the location of those projections, we conducted an initial study
    with twelve participants using qualitative and quantitative methods. We found
    that while projecting instructions and feedback on the floor was favored, participants
    who were presented the same information in front of them on a projected screen
    partially performed better in a subsequent agility assessment.}"

    for involving the user further into the experience and virtual world, but is often

    step sounds accordingly by attaching force sensing resistors (FSR) and accelerometers
    to the user's shoe. In an exciting bank robbery the user will try to rob the bank
    behind a guards back. The tension will increase as the user has to be aware of
    each step in this atmospheric experience. Each step will remind the user to pay

    sounds resulting in different noise levels.}"

    these challenges by studying the interplay of interaction techniques, device utilization,
    and task-specific activities in a user study with 24 participants from different
    but complementary angles of evaluation using an abstract task, a sensemaking task,
    and three interaction techniques. We found that different interaction techniques

    are connected to a unique embedded structure inside the item. Based on the interaction

    pattern. This pattern can be recognized by a capacitive touchscreen. Based on
    an expert design study, we present an interaction space with six categories of

    that eHMI effects last (acceptance, user experience) or even increase (crossing
    onset, perceived safety, trust, learnability, reliance) with time. We found that
    pedestrians benefit from an eHMI communicating SDVs' status, and that additionally

    We implemented two gaze-adaptive methods and compared them in a user study (n=54)

    less experience with captions prefer our gaze-adaptive methods as they assist
    them in reading. Furthermore, gaze distributions resulting from our methods are

    with each device or app which is time-consuming and settings might be overlooked.
    In this paper, we provide a stepping stone into a multi-device interface for adjusting
    privacy settings. We present three levels of information detail: 1) sensor name
    2), sensor name and information about captured data and 3) detailed information
    on each collected data type including consequences. Through a pre-study with 15
    participants, we found that users prefer the access to detailed information because
    this offers the best decision support. They also wish for a clear status communication,
    a possibility for rule-based settings, and delegation options.}"

  abstract: "{Heatmaps are a popular visualization technique that encode 2D density
    distributions using color or brightness. Experimental studies have shown though
    that both of these visual variables are inaccurate when reading and comparing
    numeric data values. A potential remedy might be to use 3D heatmaps by introducing
    height as a third dimension to encode the data. Encoding abstract data in 3D,
    however, poses many problems, too. To better understand this tradeoff, we conducted
    an empirical study (N=48) to evaluate the user performance of 2D and 3D heatmaps
    for comparative analysis tasks. We test our conditions on a conventional 2D screen,
    but also in a virtual reality environment to allow for real stereoscopic vision.
    Our main results show that 3D heatmaps are superior in terms of error rate when
    reading and comparing single data items. However, for overview tasks, the well-established
    2D heatmap performs better.}"

    to adapt to the user''s state of attention. The system only responded if the attentional
    orientation was classified as "external". The classification was based on multimodal
    EEG and eye tracking data. Seven users tested the attention-aware system in comparison
    to the unaware system. We show that the adaptation of the interface improved the

    Augmented reality (AR) in combination with virtual coaches could provide a reasonable
    solution to this challenge.We present a first investigation of the acceptance
    of an AR coaching system for balance training, which can be performed at home.
    In a human-centered design approach we developed several mock-ups and prototypes,
    and evaluated them with 76 older adults. The results suggest that older adults
    find the system encouraging and stimulating. The virtual coach is perceived as

    substantial evidence that the interactive and context-embedded AR app did not
    improve case grammar skills, vocabulary retention, and usability over the experience

    hence, the demands on usability, also for novel applications, have increased.
    This situation requires VR usability evaluation methods that can be applied quickly,
    even after a first release of an application. In this article, we describe such
    an approach, which is fully automated and does not ask users to perform predefined
    tasks in a fixed test setting. Instead, it works on recordings of the actual usage
    of a VR application from which it generates task trees. Afterwards, it analyzes
    these task trees to search for usability smells, i.e., user behavior indicating
    usability issues. Our approach provides detailed descriptions of the usability
    issues that have been found and how they can be solved. We performed a large case
    study to evaluate our approach and show that it is capable of correctly identifying
    usability issues. Although our approach is applicable for different VR interaction
    modalities, such as gaze, controller, or hand interaction, it also has limitations.
    For example, it can detect diverse issues related to user efficiency, but specific
    misunderstandings of users cannot be uncovered.}"

    for AV-pedestrian interaction are being developed based on the research conducted
    mainly in North America and Europe, where the traffic and pedestrian behavior
    are very structured and follow the rules. In other cultures (e.g., South Asia),
    this can be very unstructured (e.g., pedestrians spontaneously crossing the road
    at non-cross walks is not very uncommon). However, research on investigating cross-cultural
    differences in AV-Pedestrian interaction is scarce. This research focuses on investigating
    cross-cultural differences in AV-Pedestrian interaction to gain insights useful

    'superpowers' that go beyond human abilities, such as endless patience. To better
    identify these special abilities, we develop a performative method called 'Techno-Mimesis'
    and explore it in a series of workshops with robot designers. Specifically, we
    create 'prostheses' to allow designers to transform themselves into their future
    robot to experience use cases from the robot's perspective, e.g., 'seeing' with
    a distance sensor rather than with eyes. This imperfect imitation helps designers
    to experience being human and being robot at the same time, making differences
    apparent and facilitating the discovery of a number of potential physical, cognitive,
    and communicational robotic superpowers.}"

  abstract: "{Many online games suffer when players drop off due to lost connections
    or quitting prematurely, which leads to match terminations or game-play imbalances.
    While rule-based outcome evaluations or substitutions with bots are frequently
    used to mitigate such disruptions, these techniques are often perceived as unsatisfactory.
    Deep learning methods have successfully been used in deep player behavior modelling
    (DPBM) to produce non-player characters or bots which show more complex behavior
    patterns than those modelled using traditional AI techniques. Motivated by these
    findings, we present an investigation of the player-perceived awareness, believability
    and representativeness, when substituting disconnected players with DPBM agents
    in an online-multiplayer action game. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes
    indicate that DPBM agent substitutes perform similarly to human players and that
    players were unable to detect substitutions. Notably, players were in fact able
    to detect substitution with agents driven by more traditional heuristics.}"

    N100 amplitudes during listening when encountering unknown words. To evaluate
    the feasibility of ERPs for real-time applications, we trained a classifier that
    detects vocabulary gaps with an accuracy of 87.13\\% for reading and 82.64\\%

  abstract: "{Questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality
    (VR) evaluations and user studies. However, transitioning from virtual worlds
    to the physical world to respond to VR experience questionnaires can potentially
    lead to systematic biases. Administering questionnaires in VR (inVRQs) is becoming
    more common in contemporary research. This is based on the intuitive notion that
    inVRQs may ease participation, reduce the Break in Presence (BIP) and avoid biases.
    In this paper, we perform a systematic investigation into the effects of interrupting
    the VR experience through questionnaires using physiological data as a continuous
    and objective measure of presence. In a user study (n=50), we evaluated question-asking
    procedures using a VR shooter with two different levels of immersion. The users
    rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of
    VR. Our results indicate a reduced BIP for the employed inVRQ without affecting
    the self-reported player experience.}"

    four different programs and 13 countries – to develop speculative design futures
    in five focus areas. We then provide insights into our findings and share our
    lessons learned regarding our workshop topic – AI and Space – our process, and
    our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses
    – such as AI – through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable

    composition can be computed without relying on any marker tracking information.
    Consequently, the virtual counterparts of the tangibles can be aligned, and this
    virtual composition can be attached to a single marker as a whole, increasing
    the tracking robustness towards occlusions and perspective distortions. A technical
    evaluation shows that this approach provides more robust augmentations if a tangible
    block in a composition is occluded by at least 50\\% or perspectively distorted
    by at least 40 to 50 degrees, depending on the block's size. Additionally, a test

  abstract: "{With the advent of mixed reality devices such as the Microsoft HoloLens,
    developers have been faced with the challenge to utilize the third dimension in
    information visualization effectively. Research on stereoscopic devices has shown
    that three-dimensional representation can improve accuracy in specific tasks (e.g.,
    network visualization). Yet, so far the field has remained mute on the underlying
    mechanism. Our study systematically investigates the differences in user perception
    between a regular monitor and a mixed reality device. In a real-life within-subject
    experiment in the field with twenty-eight investment bankers, we assessed subjective
    and objective task performance with two- and three-dimensional systems, respectively.
    We tested accuracy with regard to position, size, and color using single and combined
    tasks. Our results do not show a significant difference in accuracy between mixed-reality
    and standard 2D monitor visualizations.}"

    Besides visual and auditory feedback, other senses like haptics, smell and taste
    can enhance immersion in virtual environments. Most solutions presented in the
    past require specialized hardware to provide appropriate feedback. To mitigate
    this need, researchers conceptualized approaches leveraging everyday physical
    objects as proxies instead. Transferring these approaches to varying physical
    environments and conditions, however, poses significant challenges to a variety
    of disciplines such as HCI, VR, haptics, tracking, perceptual science, design,
    etc. This workshop will explore the integration of everyday items for multi-sensory
    feedback in virtual experiences and sets course for respective future research
    endeavors. Since the community still seems to lack a cohesive agenda for advancing
    this domain, the goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals interested
    in everyday proxy objects to review past work, build a unifying research agenda,

    with 67 VR experts from academia and industry. Based on the outcomes, we conducted
    two user studies in which we tested different presentation and interaction methods
    of inVRQs and evaluated the usability and practicality of our design. We observed
    comparable completion times between inVRQs and questionnaires outside VR (nonVRQs)
    with higher enjoyment but lower usability for inVRQs. These findings advocate

    with a view to understanding better multi-domain interventions with a robot supporting
    physical activation, cognitive training and social facilitation. We employed the
    robot in a group setting in a care facility over the course of 10 weeks and 20

    present study, we explore fairness as a central, human-oriented attribute of shift

    and a validating vignette study revealed that while on an abstract level healthcare
    workers agree on equality as the guiding norm for a fair schedule, specific scheduling
    conflicts should foremost be resolved by negotiating the importance of individual
    needs. We discuss elements of organizational fairness, including transparency
    and team spirit. Finally, we present a sketch for fair scheduling systems, summarizing

    knowledge to support people''s planning activities. Participants found our calendar

    bodies and appropriate times for particular activities. All in all, it supported
    participants in negotiating external demands and personal health and wellbeing.

    three single case studies with a functional prototype. This prototype supported
    creating implementation intentions, putting them into a calendar, and being reminded
    through an object representative for the planned activity. Through the prototype,
    all three participants engaged more in the activities chosen to fulfill the intention.

    method, which enabled people to use and make sense of live data from their homes
    and to collectively interpret and reflect on anonymized data from the homes in
    our study. Our findings show how participants reconstruct behavior, both individually
    and collectively, expose the sensitive personal data of others, and use sensor
    data as evidence and for lateral surveillance within the household. We discuss
    the potential of our method as a participatory HCI method for investigating design
    of the IoT and implications created by doing data work on home sensors.}"

    the CHI 2020 venue of Hawaii signifies a coming together of four continents, the
    goal of the 2020 symposium is to bring our focus to themes that unify and foster
    solidarity across borders. Thus we select the United Nations' Sustainable Development

    and ephemeral nature of resources, including the HCI for Development (HCI4D),
    Sustainable HCI (SHCI), and Crisis Informatics (CI) communities, among several
    others. We contend that it is time for these communities to come together in addressing
    issues of global relevance and impact, and for many more to care. Additionally,
    as the venue for CHI shifts to Asia in 2021, we aspire to prepare the conference
    and its participants to grapple with themes that might offer a different and novel
    perspective when engaged within the Global South.}"

    lab studies obtained highly optimistic results with regard to real life deployments.
    We explain this with noise due to changing body postures and states as well as

    pointing precision, task time, activation patterns, and subjective ratings of
    helpfulness, confidence, and comprehensibility of each visualization. While all

    directional cues into the scene without losing immersiveness. We evaluate HiveFive
    in two studies. First, we compare biological motion (from a prerecorded swarm)
    with non-biological motion (from an algorithm), finding further evidence that
    humans can distinguish between these motion types and that, contrary to our hypothesis,
    non-biological swarm motion results in significantly faster response times. Second,
    we compare HiveFive to four other techniques and show that it not only results
    in fast response times but also has the smallest negative effect on immersion.}"

    We argue that the robot's hybrid nature on a spectrum between 'thing' and 'being'
    is a suitable framework to create such a unique experience. More specifically,
    we argue that hybridity creates ambiguity which affords a wider range of practices
    to occur, from tool use to social interaction. We evaluate this idea in an online
    study with 61 participants who rated three robots with rather biomorphic (Pepper),
    hybrid (Sympartner) or device-like (Relay) appearance. Results show that the hybrid
    design affords a broader spectrum of use compared to designs inscribing to treat
    the robot as either possession or social companion. The study offers initial insights
    on ambiguity-through-hybridity as design strategy to help robots become domestic

    of vertical deictic gestures can be significantly improved by warping the pointing
    arm. In this paper, we extend previous work by showing that models enable to also
    improve the interpretation of deictic gestures at targets all around the user.
    Through a study with 28 participants in a CVE, we analyzed the errors users make
    when interpreting deictic gestures. We derived a model that rotates the arm of
    a pointing user's avatar to improve the observing users' accuracy. A second study
    with 24 participants shows that we can improve observers' accuracy by 22.9\\%.

  abstract: "{Eye tracking systems have greatly improved in recent years, being a
    viable and affordable option as digital communication channel, especially for
    people lacking fine motor skills. Using eye tracking as an input method is challenging
    due to accuracy and ambiguity issues, and therefore research in eye gaze interaction
    is mainly focused on better pointing and typing methods. However, these methods
    eventually need to be assimilated to enable users to control application interfaces.
    A common approach to employ eye tracking for controlling application interfaces
    is to emulate mouse and keyboard functionality. We argue that the emulation approach
    incurs unnecessary interaction and visual overhead for users, aggravating the
    entire experience of gaze-based computer access. We discuss how the knowledge
    about the interface semantics can help reducing the interaction and visual overhead
    to improve the user experience. Thus, we propose the efficient introspection of
    interfaces to retrieve the interface semantics and adapt the interaction with
    eye gaze. We have developed a Web browser, GazeTheWeb, that introspects Web page
    interfaces and adapts both the browser interface and the interaction elements
    on Web pages for gaze input. In a summative lab study with 20 participants, GazeTheWeb
    allowed the participants to accomplish information search and browsing tasks significantly
    faster than an emulation approach. Additional feasibility tests of GazeTheWeb
    in lab and home environment showcase its effectiveness in accomplishing daily
    Web browsing activities and adapting large variety of modern Web pages to suffice
    the interaction for people with motor impairment.}"

    into MMORPGs. By developing a measure of in-game social anxiety, we find that
    although fear and apprehension of socializing in the physical and game worlds
    are related, they differently affect preferences, behaviours, and experiences.
    Social anxiety in the physical world drives reasons for playing, whereas in-game
    anxiety affects behaviours, reducing participation in activities related to socializing
    and difficult in-game challenges. Our findings can inform the design of social
    games and the links between social anxiety and social gaming.}"

    usually based on the assumption of a rational behaviour of its participants. Since
    travel demand models have been applied in particular for motorized traffic, only
    little is known about the influence of variables that affect both the choice of
    trip destination and the route decision in pedestrian and cycling models. In order
    to create urban spaces that encourage cycling and walking, we propose a VR (Virtual
    Reality) pedestrian simulator which involves walk-in-place locomotion. Thus, identical
    conditions are obtained for all subjects which is not feasible in real world field
    research with naturally varying environmental influences. As a first step, our
    qualitative and quantitative user study revealed that walking in a VR treadmill
    felt safest and most intuitive, although walking in it took in return more energy
    than walking-in-place with VR trackers only.}"

    Biometric authentication methods promise to fulfill both aspects to a high degree,
    yet they come with severe drawbacks, such as the lack of changeability of the
    utilized trait, in case it is leaked or stolen. To compensate for these disadvantages,
    we introduce a novel class of biometric authentication systems in this work, named
    "Functional Biometrics". This approach regards the human body as a function that
    transforms a stimulus which is applied to the body by the authentication system.
    Both, the stimulus and the measured body reflection form a pair that can subsequently
    be used for authentication, yet the underlying function remains secret. Following
    this approach, we intend to disprove some of the drawbacks of traditional biometrics.}'

    task as gamification has already been shown to be effective here in previous work.
    Based on these descriptions, an implementation was made for each concept and given
    to the creator. In a between-subjects study (n=71), our approach was compared
    to a no-gamification condition and two conditions with fixed gamification settings.
    We found that providing participants with an implementation of their own concept
    significantly increased the amount of generated tags compared to the other conditions.
    Although the quality of tags was lower, the number of usable tags remained significantly
    higher in comparison, suggesting the usefulness of this approach.}"

  abstract: '{One of the great benefits of virtual reality (VR) is the implementation
    of features that go beyond realism. Common "unrealistic" locomotion techniques
    (like teleportation) can avoid spatial limitation of tracking, but minimize potential
    benefits of more realistic techniques (e.g. walking). As an alternative that combines
    realistic physical movement with hyper-realistic virtual outcome, we present JumpVR,
    a jump-based locomotion augmentation technique that virtually scales users'' physical
    jumps. In a user study (N=28), we show that jumping in VR (regardless of scaling)
    can significantly increase presence, motivation and immersion compared to teleportation,
    while largely not increasing simulator sickness. Further, participants reported
    higher immersion and motivation for most scaled jumping variants than forward-jumping.
    Our work shows the feasibility and benefits of jumping in VR and explores suitable
    parameters for its hyper-realistic scaling. We discuss design implications for
    VR experiences and research.}'

    turned them into two software applications. The MTP''s initial skepticism dissolved,
    while radiologists unanimously emphasized wellbeing and demonstrated how they
    work towards improving it. Based on our insights, the applications resonated well

    to browse model repositories, preview the models in-situ, and adapt them to their
    environment in a simple and immediate fashion. Mix&Match aims to provide users
    with CSG operations which can be based on both virtual and real geometry. We present

    daily duties. However, the manual transfer of patients is a major risk factor
    for injuries to the back. Although the Kinaesthetics Care Conception can help
    to address this issue, existing support for the integration of the concept into
    nursing-care practice is low. We present NurseCare, a mobile system that aims
    to promote the practical application of ergonomic patient transfers based on the
    Kinaesthetics Care Conception. NurseCare consists of a wearable and a smartphone
    app. Key features of NurseCare include mobile accessible instructions for ergonomic
    patient transfers, in-situ feedback for the risky bending of the back, and long-term
    feedback. We evaluated NurseCare in a nine participant 'in-the-wild' evaluation.
    Results indicate that NurseCare can facilitate ergonomic work while providing
    a high user experience adequate to the nurses' work domain, and reveal how NurseCare
    can be incorporated in given practices.}"

    Outline Pursuits which extends a primary pointing modality for gaze-assisted selection

    an outline that is traversed by a moving stimulus. This affords completion of
    the selection by gaze attention to the intended target's outline motion, detected

    to repair such errors by replacing the erroneous correction or suggesting alternatives.
    We integrated both parts in a generic Android component and thus present a research

    we investigate user testing of mid-air interaction without real users, utilizing
    biomechanically simulated AI agents trained using deep Reinforcement Learning
    (RL). We implement this in a pointing task and four experimental conditions, demonstrating
    that the simulated fatigue data matches human fatigue data. We also compare two
    effort models: 1) instantaneous joint torques commonly used in computer animation
    and robotics, and 2) the recent Three Compartment Controller (3CC-) model from
    biomechanical literature. 3CC- yields movements that are both more efficient and
    relaxed, whereas with instantaneous joint torques, the RL agent can easily generate
    movements that are quickly tiring or only reach the targets slowly and inaccurately.
    Our work demonstrates that deep RL combined with the 3CC- provides a viable tool

  abstract: "{We present the first real-world dataset and quantitative evaluation
    of visual attention of mobile device users in-situ, i.e. while using their devices
    during everyday routine. Understanding user attention is a core research challenge
    in mobile HCI but previous approaches relied on usage logs or self-reports that
    are only proxies and consequently do neither reflect attention completely nor
    accurately. Our evaluations are based on Everyday Mobile Visual Attention (EMVA)
    – a new 32-participant dataset containing around 472 hours of video snippets recorded
    over more than two weeks in real life using the front-facing camera as well as
    associated usage logs, interaction events, and sensor data. Using an eye contact
    detection method, we are first to quantify the highly dynamic nature of everyday
    visual attention across users, mobile applications, and usage contexts. We discuss
    key insights from our analyses that highlight the potential and inform the design
    of future mobile attentive user interfaces.}"

  abstract: "{Rapid prototyping of interactive textiles is still challenging, since
    manual skills, several processing steps, and expert knowledge are involved. We
    present Rapid Iron-On User Interfaces, a novel fabrication approach for empowering
    designers and makers to enhance fabrics with interactive functionalities. It builds
    on heat-activated adhesive materials consisting of smart textiles and printed
    electronics, which can be flexibly ironed onto the fabric to create custom interface
    functionality. To support rapid fabrication in a sketching-like fashion, we developed
    a handheld dispenser tool for directly applying continuous functional tapes of
    desired length as well as discrete patches. We introduce versatile compositions
    techniques that allow for creating complex circuits, utilizing commodity textile
    accessories and sketching custom-shaped I/O modules. We further contribute a comprehensive
    library of components for input, output, wiring and computing. Three example applications,
    results from technical experiments and expert reviews demonstrate the functionality,
    versatility and potential of this approach.}"

  abstract: "{Enrollment in online courses has sharply increased in higher education.
    Although online education can be scaled to large audiences, the lack of interaction
    between educators and learners is difficult to replace and remains a primary challenge
    in the field. Conversational agents may alleviate this problem by engaging in
    natural interaction and by scaffolding learners' understanding similarly to educators.
    However, whether this approach can also be used to enrich online video lectures
    has largely remained unknown. We developed Sara, a conversational agent that appears
    during an online video lecture. She provides scaffolds by voice and text when
    needed and includes a voice-based input mode. An evaluation with 182 learners
    in a 2 x 2 lab experiment demonstrated that Sara, compared to more traditional
    conversational agents, significantly improved learning in a programming task.
    This study highlights the importance of including scaffolding and voice-based
    conversational agents in online videos to improve meaningful learning.}"

    in this workshop, we invite designers, researchers, and practitioners from the
    sustainable HCI, persuasive design, AutomotiveUI, and mobility communities to
    collaborate in finding ways to make future mobility more sustainable. Using embodied

  abstract: "{When interacting with materials, we infer many of their properties through
    tactile stimuli. These stimuli are caused by our manual interaction with the material,
    they are therefore closely coupled to our actions. Similarly, if we are subjected
    to a vibrotactile stimulus with a frequency directly coupled to our actions, we
    do not experience vibration - instead we experience this as a material property.
    My thesis explores this phenomenon of 'material experience' in three parts. Part
    I contributes two novel devices, a flexible phone which provides haptic feedback
    as it is being deformed, and a system which can track a finger and simultaniously
    provide haptic feedback. Part II investigates how vibration is perceived, when
    coupled to motion: what are the effects of varying feedback parameters and what
    are the effects of different types of motion? Part III reflects and contextualizes
    the findings presented in the previous sections. In this extended abstract I briefly
    outline the most important aspects of my thesis and questions I've left unanswered,
    while also reflecting on the writing process.}"

    causes a discrepancy between design recommendations based on user research, and

    while staying inside a finite, but still very large, physical space. We present
    Telewalk, a novel locomotion approach that combines curvature and translation
    gains known from RDW research in a perceivable way. This combination enables Telewalk
    to be applied even within a physical space of 3m x 3m. Utilizing the head rotation
    as input device enables directional changes without any physical turns to keep
    the user always on an optimal circular path inside the real world while freely
    walking inside the virtual one. In a user study we found that even though motion
    sickness susceptible participants reported respective symptoms, Telewalk did result
    in stronger feelings of presence and immersion and was seen as more natural then

    Pupillary Activity (LHIPA), is able to discriminate cognitive load (vis-a-vis
    task difficulty) in several experiments where the Index of Pupillary Activity
    fails to do so. Rationale for the LHIPA is tied to the functioning of the human
    autonomic nervous system yielding a hybrid measure based on the ratio of Low/High
    frequencies of pupil oscillation. The paper's contribution is twofold. First,
    full documentation is provided for the calculation of the LHIPA. As with the IPA,
    it is possible for researchers to apply this metric to their own experiments where
    a measure of cognitive load is of interest. Second, robustness of the LHIPA is
    shown in analysis of three experiments, a restrictive fixed-gaze number counting
    task, a less restrictive fixed-gaze n-back task, and an applied eye-typing task.}"

    tracking in security applications. We present a holistic view on gaze-based security
    applications. In particular, we canvassed the literature and classify the utility
    of gaze in security applications into a) authentication, b) privacy protection,
    and c) gaze monitoring during security critical tasks. This allows us to chart
    several research directions, most importantly 1) conducting field studies of implicit
    and explicit gaze-based authentication due to recent advances in eye tracking,
    2) research on gaze-based privacy protection and gaze monitoring in security critical
    tasks which are under-investigated yet very promising areas, and 3) understanding
    the privacy implications of pervasive eye tracking. We discuss the most promising
    opportunities and most pressing challenges of eye tracking for security that will
    shape research in gaze-based security applications for the next decade.}"

    so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend
    much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours). Participants used our

    Recent research on the design of vehicle-pedestrian communication (VPC) focuses

    We conducted a workshop with VIP (N=6), discussing current issues in road traffic
    and comparing communication concepts proposed by literature. A thematic analysis
    unveiled two important themes: number of communicating vehicles and content (affecting
    duration). Subsequently, we investigated these in a second user study in virtual
    reality (N=33, 8 VIP) comparing the VPC between groups of abilities. We found
    that trust and understanding is enhanced and cognitive load reduced when all relevant
    vehicles communicate; high content messages also reduce cognitive load.}"

    the knowledge of its existence, there is currently a lack of a deeper understanding

    various aspects such as the number of lanes, right of way, and configuration.
    With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, this system will change. Research has
    already addressed the missing communication possibilities when no human driver
    is needed. However, there is no common evaluation standard for the proposed external
    communication concept with respect to the complexity of the traffic system. We
    have therefore investigated the evaluation of these in Virtual Reality, in monitor-based,
    and in prototypical setups with special regard to scalability. We found that simulated

  abstract: "{Given that an increasing number of people cultivate poor eating habits,
    encouraging people to eat healthy is important. One way to motivate people eating
    healthy is using gamification, i.e. using game elements in a non-game context.
    Often, a static set of gamification elements is used. However, research suggests
    that the motivational impact of gamification elements differs substantially across
    users, demanding personalized approaches. In this paper, we contribute to this
    by investigating the perception of frequently used gamification elements in the
    healthy eating domain and correlations to Hexad user types in an online study
    (N=237). To do so, we created storyboards illustrating these gamification elements
    and show their comprehensibility in a lab study (N=8). Our results validate and
    extend previous research in the healthy eating domain, underline the need for
    personalization and could be used to inform the design of gamified systems for
    healthy eating.}"

    forehead. We were able to reproduce these findings and explored five further regions
    to get a more complete picture of the occurrence of the funneling illusion on
    the head. The results of our study (24 participants) show that the actuator distance,
    for which the funneling illusion occurs, strongly depends upon the head region.
    Moreover, we evaluated the centralizing bias (smaller perceived than actual actuator
    distances) for different head regions, which also showed widely varying characteristics.
    We computed a detailed heat map of vibrotactile localization accuracies on the
    head. The results inform the design of future tactile head-mounted displays that

    brake mechanism to provide large-scale shape of virtual objects. The multiple
    degrees-of-freedom enables users to adapt the controller to their preferred techniques
    and grip. In addition, surface textures are rendered with a voice coil actuator
    based on contact vibrations; and spatialized audio is determined based on the
    progression of sound through the geometry around the user. We design a scavenger
    hunt game that demonstrates how our device enables blind users to navigate a complex

    step sounds accordingly by attaching force sensing resistors (FSR) and accelerometers

    behind a guards back. The tension will increase as the user has to be aware of

    the spatial alignment of an oscilloscope's display and probe interferes with the
    cognitive processing of data visualisations, hence increasing the probability
    of errors and required time. We compared a fixed placed oscilloscope, in-situ
    projections, user positioned tablets, and head-mounted display while measuring
    completion times, subjective workload, number of errors, and personal preferences
    after each task. Results indicate that the oscilloscope produced the lowest completion
    time compared to other modalities. However, visualising data on a user positioned

    usage contexts and specify interactions that may facilitate domestic applications.
    Our work illustrates the concept of interactive smart windows and provides insights
    regarding their design, development, and user controls for adaptive walls. We
    identify design dimensions and challenges to stimulate further development in
    the domain of adaptive buildings.}"
